# How people think?

One hundred billion people have walked this planet.
Nearly eight billion of them are alive today.
Each has a story, few have a microphone.
共有 1000亿人在这个星球上行走，其中近80亿人今天还活着。每个人都有一个故事，但很少人机会表达。

Each has seen something different and thought something unique. Most know something you can’t fathom, and you have experienced stuff they wouldn’t believe.
每个人都看到了不同的东西，都有自己独特的想法。大多数人都知道一些你无法理解的事情，你也经历过一些他们不相信的事情。

But so many behaviors are universal across generations and geographies. Circumstances change, but people’s reactions don’t. Technologies evolve, but insecurities, blind spots, and gullibility rarely does.
但如此多的行为是跨代跨地域的普遍行为。环境会改变，但人们的反应不会改变。技术在发展，但不安全感、盲点和易受骗性很少发生变化。

This article describes 17 of what I think are the most common and influential aspects of how people think.这篇文章描述了我认为人们思考方式中最常见和最有影响力的17个方面。

It’s a long post, but each point can be read individually. Skip the ones you don’t agree with and reread the ones you do – that itself is a common way people think.这是一篇很长的文章，但每一点都可以单独阅读。跳过那些你不同意的，重读那些你同意的，这本身就是人们思考的常见方式。

1. Everyone belongs to a tribe and underestimates how influential that tribe is on their thinking.每个人都属于一个部落，低估了这个部落对他们思维的影响。

Tribes are everywhere – countries, states, parties, companies, industries, departments, investment styles, economic philosophies, religions, families, schools, majors, credentials. Everyone loves their tribe because there’s comfort in knowing other people who understand your background and share your goals.部落无处不在——国家、州、政党、公司、行业、部门、投资风格、经济哲学、宗教、家庭、学校、专业、证书。每个人都爱自己的部落，因为认识了解你背景并分享你目标的其他人会让人感到安慰。

But tribes have their own rules, beliefs, and ideas. Some of them you might disagree with; some are even abjectly terrible. Yet they remain supported because no one wants to risk being shunned by a tribe that’s become part of their identity. So people either willingly nod along with bad ideas, or become blinded by tribal loyalty at how bad the ideas are to begin with.但是部落有自己的规则、信仰和想法。其中一些你可能不同意；有些甚至可怕到了极点。然而，他们仍然受到支持，因为没有人愿意冒险被一个已经成为他们身份的一部分的部落所回避。因此，人们要么心甘情愿地点头同意坏主意，要么被部落的忠诚蒙蔽了双眼，看不清这些想法到底有多坏。

2. What people present to the world is a tiny fraction of what’s going on inside their head.人们向世界展示的只是他们头脑中发生的事情的一小部分。

The Library of Congress holds three million books, or something like a quarter of a trillion words.

All of the information accessible on the internet is estimated at 40 trillion gigabytes, which is roughly enough to hold a high-def video lasting the entire 14 billion years since the big bang.

So much of history has been recorded.

But then you remember, that’s just what’s been publicly shared, recorded, and published. It’s a trivial amount of what’s actually happened, and an infinitesimal amount of what’s gone through people’s heads.

As much as we know about how crazy, weird, talented, and insightful people can be, we are blind to perhaps 99.99999999% of it. The most prolific over-sharers disclose maybe a thousandth of one percent of what they’ve been through and what they’re thinking.尽管我们知道人们有多么疯狂、古怪、有天赋和有洞察力，但我们对其中的99.9999999%却视而不见。最多产的过度分享者披露了他们所经历和所想的事情的千分之一。

One thing this does is gives a false view of success. Most of what people share is what they want you to see. Skills are advertised, flaws are hidden. Wins are exaggerated, losses are downplayed. Doubt and anxiety are rarely shared on social media. Defeated soldiers and failed CEOs rarely sit for interviews.这样做的一件事是给人一种错误的成功观。人们分享的大部分内容都是他们想让你看到的。技能被宣传，缺陷被隐藏。胜利被夸大，损失被淡化。社交媒体上很少分享怀疑和焦虑。战败的士兵和失败的首席执行官很少参加面试。

Most things are harder than they look and not as fun as they seem because the information we’re exposed to tends to be a highlight reel of what people want you to know about themselves to increase their own chances of success. It’s easiest to convince people that you’re special if they don’t know you well enough to see all the ways you’re not.大多数事情都比看起来更难，也不像看上去那么有趣，因为我们接触到的信息往往是人们希望你了解自己以增加自己成功机会的精彩片段。如果人们对你不够了解，看不到你的所有缺点，那么最容易让他们相信你是特别的。

When you are keenly aware of your own struggles but blind to others’, it’s easy to assume you’re missing some skill or secret that others have. Sometimes that’s true. More often you’re just blind to how much everyone else is making it up as they go, one challenge at a time.当你敏锐地意识到自己的挣扎，却对别人视而不见时，你很容易认为自己缺少了别人拥有的一些技能或秘密。有时这是真的。更多的时候，你只是看不到其他人在做什么，一次一个挑战。

3. Prediction is about probability and putting the odds of success in your favor. But observers mostly judge you in binary terms, right or wrong.预测是关于概率和把成功的几率放在对你有利的位置上。但观察家们大多以二元术语来判断你，对还是错。

There’s a scene in the movie Zero Dark Thirty where the CIA director questions an analyst team who claim to have located Osama Bin Laden.电影《零暗三十》中有一个场景，中央情报局局长向一个声称找到了奥萨马·本·拉登的分析小组提问。

“I’m about to go look the president in the eye,” he says. “And what I’d like to know, no bullshit, very simply, is he there, or is he not f*cking there?”他说：“我要去看看总统的眼睛。”。“我想知道的是，不是胡说八道，很简单，他在那里，还是不在那里？”

The team’s leader says there’s a 60% to 80% chance Bin Laden is in the compound.该小组负责人表示，本·拉登有60%到80%的可能性在该大院内。

“Is that a yes or a no?” the director asks.“这是肯定的还是否定的？”导演问道。

A young analyst jumps in. “One hundred percent chance he’s there,” she says.一位年轻的分析师插话了。“他百分之百有可能在那里，”她说。

Everyone is stunned.大家都惊呆了。

“OK fine, 95%, because I know certainty freaks you guys out. But it’s 100%.”“好吧，95%，因为我知道确定性会吓到你们。但这是100%。”

It’s a good example of how uncomfortable probability can be.这是一个很好的例子，说明概率是多么令人不安。

The idea that something can be likely and not happen, or unlikely](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-three-sides-of-risk/ ) and still happen, is one of the world’s most important tricks.认为某事可能发生但不发生，或不可能发生但仍在发生的想法是世界上最重要的技巧之一。

Most people get that certainty is rare, and the best you can do is make decisions where the odds are in your favor. They understand you can be smart and end up wrong, or dumb and end up right, because that’s [how luck and risk work](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/ironies-of-luck/ ).大多数人都知道，确定性是罕见的，你所能做的最好的决定就是在胜算对你有利的地方做出决定。他们明白你可能聪明到头来是错的，也可能愚蠢到头来是对的，因为这就是运气和风险的运作方式。

But almost no one actually uses probability in the real world, especially when judging others’ success.但在现实世界中，几乎没有人真正使用概率，尤其是在判断他人的成功时。

Most of what people care about is, “Were you right or wrong?”大多数人关心的是，“你是对还是错？”

Probability is about nuance and gradation. But in the real world people pay attention to black and white.概率是关于细微差别和层次的。但在现实世界中，人们关注的是黑人和白人。

If you said something will happen and it happens, you were right. If you said it will happen and it doesn’t, you’re wrong. That’s how people think, because it requires the least amount of effort. It’s hard to convince others – or yourself – that there could have been an alternative outcome when there’s a real-world outcome sitting in front of you.如果你说有什么事情会发生，而且确实发生了，那你是对的。如果你说这会发生，但事实并非如此，那你就错了。人们就是这样想的，因为这需要最少的努力。当现实世界的结果摆在你面前时，很难说服其他人——或者你自己——有其他的结果。

The core here is that people think they want an accurate view of the future, but what they really crave is certainty.这里的核心是，人们认为他们想要对未来有一个准确的看法，但他们真正渴望的是确定性。

It’s normal to want to rid yourself of the painful reality of not knowing what’s going to happen next. Someone who tells you there’s a 60% chance of a recession happening doesn’t do much to erase that pain. They might be adding to it. But someone who says, “There is going to be a recession this year,” offers something to grab onto with both hands that feels like taking control of your future.

After the Bin Laden raid, President Obama [later said](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/10/this-is-50-50-behind-obamas-decision-to-kill-bin-laden/263449/ ) the odds placed on whether Bin Laden was actually in the target house were 50/50. A few years ago I heard one of the SEALS involved in the mission speak at a conference. He said, regardless of whether Bin Laden was in the house, the team felt the odds they’d all be killed in the mission were also 50/50. So here we have a 75% chance that the raid would have ended in disappointment or catastrophe.在本·拉登突袭之后，奥巴马总统后来表示，本·拉登是否真的在目标房屋内的几率为50比50。几年前，我在一次会议上听到一名参与此次任务的海豹队员发言。他说，无论本·拉登是否在家，团队都认为他们在任务中被击毙的几率是50/50。因此，我们有75%的可能性，这次突袭会以失望或灾难告终。

It didn’t – but that alternative outcome isn’t a world many pay much attention to.事实并非如此，但这一替代结果并不是一个很多人关注的世界。

**4. We are extrapolating machines in a world where nothing too good or too bad lasts indefinitely.**我们在一个没有太好或太坏的东西可以无限期持续的世界里推测机器。

When you’re in the middle of a powerful trend it’s difficult to imagine a force strong enough to turn things the other way.当你处在一个强大的趋势中时，很难想象有一种强大到足以扭转局面的力量。

What we tend to miss is that what turns trends around usually isn’t an outside force. It’s when a subtle side effect of that trend erodes what made it powerful to begin with.我们往往忽视的是，扭转趋势的通常不是外力。正是这种趋势的一个微妙的副作用侵蚀了它最初的强大之处。

When there are no recessions, people get confident. When they get confident they take risks. When they take risks, you get recessions.当没有衰退时，人们会变得自信。当他们变得自信时，他们就会冒险。当他们冒险时，你就会陷入衰退。

When markets never crash, valuations go up. When valuations go up, markets are prone to crash.当市场从不崩盘时，估值就会上升。当估值上升时，市场很容易崩溃。

When there’s a crisis, people get motivated. When they get motivated they frantically solve problems. When they solve problems crises tend to end.当出现危机时，人们会有动力。当他们受到激励时，他们会疯狂地解决问题。当他们解决问题时，危机往往会结束。

Good times plant the seeds of their destruction through complacency and leverage, and bad times plant the seeds of their turnaround through opportunity and panic-driven problem-solving.好时光通过自满和杠杆作用播下毁灭的种子，坏时光通过机遇和恐慌驱动的问题解决播下扭转局面的种子。

We know that in hindsight. It’s almost always true, almost everywhere.事后我们知道这一点。几乎所有地方都是这样。

But we tend to *only* know it in hindsight because we are extrapolating machines, and drawing straight lines when forecasting is easier than imagining how people might adapt and change their behavior.但我们往往事后才知道这一点，因为我们是在推测机器，当预测比想象人们如何适应和改变他们的行为更容易时，我们就画直线。

When alcohol from fermentation reaches a certain point it kills the yeast that made it in the first place. Most powerful trends end the same way. And that kind of force isn’t intuitive, requiring you to consider not just how a trend impacts people, but how that impact will change people’s behavior in a way that could end the trend.当酒精发酵到一定程度时，首先会杀死制造酒精的酵母。大多数强大的趋势都以同样的方式结束。这种力量是不直观的，它要求你不仅要考虑趋势如何影响人们，还要考虑这种影响将如何改变人们的行为，从而结束趋势。

**5. There are limits to our sanity. Optimism and pessimism always overshoot because the only way to know the boundaries of either is to go a little bit past them.**我们的理智是有限的。乐观主义和悲观主义总是过度，因为要知道两者的界限，唯一的办法就是稍微超越它们。

Jerry Seinfeld had the most popular show on TV. Then he quit.杰里·森菲尔德是电视上最受欢迎的节目。然后他辞职了。

He later said he killed his show while it was thriving because the only way to identify the top is to experience the decline, which he had no interest in. Maybe the show could keep rising, maybe it couldn’t. He was fine not knowing the answer.他后来说，他在自己的节目繁荣的时候就把它扼杀了，因为确定顶尖人物的唯一方法就是经历衰落，而他对此并不感兴趣。也许这个节目可以继续上升，也许它不能。他不知道答案很好。

If you want to know why there’s a long history of the world blowing past the boundaries of sanity, bouncing from boom to bust, absurdity to absurdity, it’s because so few people have Jerry’s mentality. Opportunity is scarce and people don’t want to leave any on the table. So they insist on knowing where the top is.如果你想知道为什么这个世界有一段漫长的历史，它会冲破理智的界限，从繁荣到萧条，从荒谬到荒谬，那是因为很少有人有杰里那样的心态。机会很少，人们不想留下任何机会。所以他们坚持要知道顶部在哪里。

Most things in the world are a mix of facts and emotions. How much steel can this factory produce (a fact), and what are investors willing to pay for that output (an emotion).世界上大多数事情都是事实和情感的混合体。这家工厂能生产多少钢材（一个事实），投资者愿意为这一产量付出什么（一种情感）。

The important thing is that emotions aren’t something you can predict with a formula.重要的是，情绪不是可以用公式预测的。

*What is bitcoin worth? How high can Tesla go?* *How much crazier can politics get before voters revolt?* The only way to answer those questions is to know what kinds of moods people will be in in the future – how optimistic they’ll feel, what they’ll want to believe, and how persuasive storytellers are. Which is impossible to know. I don’t know what kind of mood I’ll be in tonight, let alone how a bunch of strangers will feel years in the future.比特币的价值是什么？特斯拉能飞多高？在选民造反之前，政治还能疯狂到什么程度？回答这些问题的唯一方法是了解人们未来的心情——他们会有多乐观，他们想相信什么，讲故事的人有多有说服力。这是不可能知道的。我不知道今晚我会有什么样的心情，更不用说一群陌生人在未来几年会有什么样的感受了。

The only way to find the limits of people’s moods – the only way to find the top – is to keep pushing until we’ve gone too far, when we can look back and say, “Ah, I guess *that* was the limit.”找到人们情绪极限的唯一方法——找到巅峰的唯一方法——就是不断努力，直到我们走得太远，那时我们可以回头说，“啊，我想那就是极限。”

It’s tempting to watch things go from boom to bust and think, “Why are people doing this? Are they crazy?”

Probably not. They’re just rationally looking for the limits of what everyone else can handle.可能不会。他们只是理性地寻找其他人所能处理的极限。

**6. Ignoring that people who think about the world in unique ways you like also think about the world in unique ways you won’t like.**忽视那些以你喜欢的独特方式思考世界的人也以你不喜欢的独特方式思考世界。

A recent profile of Eliud Kipchoge, the world’s best marathon runner, [wrote](https://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/othersport/arid-40732662.html ):世界最佳马拉松运动员埃利乌德·基普乔格（EliudKipchoge）最近的个人资料写道：





> 
  Cramped in a dull room with hours to kill, the Olympic medallists did what most would do: they opened their phones, logged into wifi, and started scrolling through the river of goodwill messages.奥运会奖牌获得者们被挤在一间死气沉沉的房间里，要消磨几个小时，他们做了大多数人都会做的事情：打开手机，登录wifi，开始在友好信息的河流中滚动。



  All except one. Kipchoge placed his phone in front of him and never touched it, sitting there — for hours — in contented silence.除了一个以外，其他都是。Kipchoge把手机放在面前，从未碰过它，在那里静静地坐了几个小时，心满意足。



  Bashir Abdi, the bronze medallist from Belgium, recalls the story in laughing disbelief, adding a line, only half-joking, that those in the sport have said many times about Kipchoge.来自比利时的铜牌得主巴希尔·阿卜迪（BashirAbdi）笑着难以置信地回忆起这个故事，并补充了一句话，只是半开玩笑，这句话是体育界人士多次谈到基普霍格的。



  “He is not human.”“他不是人类。”

*He is not human*.他不是人。

Some variation of that phrase can be used on most of your role models – people who have extreme, outlying success. You like them because they do things other people would never consider, or can’t even comprehend.这句话的一些变体可以用在你的大多数榜样身上——那些拥有极端、偏远成功的人。你喜欢他们是因为他们做了别人永远不会考虑，甚至无法理解的事情。

Some of those traits are awesome and you should look up to them. Others aren’t.这些特质中有一些非常棒，你应该尊重它们。其他人则不然。

Kanye West once put it:

> 
  If you want these crazy ideas and these crazy stages, this crazy music, and this crazy way of thinking, there’s a chance it might come from a crazy person.如果你想要这些疯狂的想法，这些疯狂的舞台，这种疯狂的音乐，这种疯狂的思维方式，那么它可能来自一个疯子。

Paul Graham put it this way: “Half the distinguishing qualities of the eminent are actually disadvantages.”保罗·格雷厄姆（PaulGraham）是这样说的：“杰出人士的突出品质中有一半实际上是劣势。”

Andrew Wilkinson [says](https://twitter.com/awilkinson/status/1386698431905730565?s=20 ): “Most successful people are just a walking anxiety disorder harnessed for productivity.”安德鲁·威尔金森（AndrewWilkinson）说：“大多数成功人士只是一种行走焦虑症，被用来提高生产力。”

I’ve always thought that people who are abnormally good at one thing tend to be abnormally bad at something else. Or maybe not bad, but something you wouldn’t necessarily want in your own life. They’re [natural maniacs](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/natural-maniacs/ ), extreme in every way, good and bad.我一直认为，在一件事上异常擅长的人往往在另一件事上异常糟糕。或者也许还不错，但有些东西你在自己的生活中并不一定想要。他们是天生的疯子，无论好坏，都是极端的。

But it’s so easy to ignore that fact when you admire someone. It gets dangerous when you admire a person for their good traits but start emulating their bad traits because you mistakenly believe that’s what made them great. That’s part of the saying, “Never meet your heroes.”但当你崇拜某人时，很容易忽视这个事实。当你钦佩一个人的好品质，但却开始模仿他们的坏品质，因为你错误地认为这就是他们之所以伟大的原因，这就变得很危险了。这是谚语的一部分，“永远不要遇到你的英雄。”

Beyond personal traits, jealousy is often misguided because you can’t pick and choose parts of someone’s life to emulate. Naval once wrote:除了个人特质之外，嫉妒常常被误导，因为你无法选择和选择他人生活中的某些部分来效仿。海军曾写道：

> 
  One day, I realized with all these people I was jealous of, I couldn’t just choose little aspects of their life. I couldn’t say I want his body, I want her money, I want his personality. You have to be that person. Do you want to actually be that person with all of their reactions, their desires, their family, their happiness level, their outlook on life, their self-image? If you’re not willing to do a wholesale, 24/7, 100 percent swap with who that person is, then there is no point in being jealous.有一天，我意识到，和这些我嫉妒的人在一起，我不能只选择他们生活中的一些小方面。我不能说我想要他的身体，我想要她的钱，我想要他的个性。你必须是那个人。你真的想成为一个拥有所有反应、欲望、家庭、幸福水平、人生观和自我形象的人吗？如果你不愿意与那个人进行全天候、100%的批发交易，那么嫉妒是没有意义的。

Years ago, David Brooks [gave a](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/opinion/30brooks.html?_r=0 ) real-world example:多年前，David Brooks给出了一个真实的例子：

> 
  Two things happened to Sandra Bullock this month. First, she won an Academy Award for best actress. Then came the news reports claiming that her husband is an adulterous jerk. So the philosophic question of the day is: Would you take that as a deal? Would you exchange a tremendous professional triumph for a severe personal blow?桑德拉·布洛克这个月发生了两件事。首先，她获得了奥斯卡最佳女主角奖。接着有新闻报道称她的丈夫是一个通奸的混蛋。因此，今天的哲学问题是：你会把这当作交易吗？你会用巨大的职业胜利来换取严重的个人打击吗？



  If you had to take more than three seconds to think about this question, you are absolutely crazy.如果你不得不花三秒钟以上的时间来思考这个问题，你绝对是疯了。

Admiration can be so gullible.

**7. We are pushed toward maximizing efficiency in a way that leaves no room for error, despite room for error being the most important factor of long-term success.**7、尽管犯错的空间是长期成功的最重要因素，但我们正努力以一种不留任何错误余地的方式实现效率最大化。

The world is competitive. If you don’t exploit an opportunity your competition will. So opportunity is usually exploited to its fullest extent as soon as possible.世界竞争激烈。如果你不抓住机会，你的竞争对手就会。因此，机会通常被尽可能快地充分利用。

That’s great – it pushes the world forward. But it has a nasty side effect: When all opportunity is exploited there is no room for error, and when there’s no room for error any system exposed to volatility and accident will eventually break.这太棒了，它推动了世界向前发展。但它有一个恶劣的副作用：当所有的机会都被利用时，就没有犯错的余地，当没有犯错的余地时，任何暴露在波动和事故中的系统最终都会崩溃。

Describing the supply chain fiasco of the last year, Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen [explained](https://twitter.com/typesfast/status/1453753924960219145 ):Flexport首席执行官Ryan Petersen在描述去年供应链的惨败时解释道：

> 
  What caused all the supply chain bottlenecks? Modern finance with its obsession with “Return on Equity.”是什么导致了所有供应链瓶颈？现代金融痴迷于“股本回报率”

  To show great ROE almost every CEO stripped their company of all but the bare minimum of assets. Just in time everything. No excess capacity. No strategic reserves. No cash on the balance sheet. Minimal R&amp;D.为了显示良好的净资产收益率，几乎每一位首席执行官都剥夺了公司的所有资产，除了最低限度的资产。一切都很及时。无过剩容量。没有战略储备。资产负债表上没有现金。最低限度的研发。

  We stripped the shock absorbers out of the economy in pursuit of better short term metrics. Now as we’re facing a hundred year storm of demand, our infrastructure simply can’t keep up.为了追求更好的短期指标，我们从经济中剥离了减震器。现在，我们面临着百年一遇的需求风暴，我们的基础设施根本跟不上。

  The global logistics companies have no excess capacity, there are no reserves of chassis (trailers for hauling containers), no extra shipping containers, no extra yard space, no extra warehouse capacity. The brands have no extra inventory. Manufacturers have no extra components or raw materials on hand.全球物流公司没有过剩产能，没有底盘储备（拖车用于运输集装箱），没有额外的集装箱，没有额外的堆场空间，没有额外的仓库容量。这些品牌没有额外库存。制造商手头没有额外的组件或原材料。

He’s right, but part of me can also empathize with the CEOs who maximized efficiency because if they didn’t their competition would have and put them out of business. There’s a weird quirk of human behavior that incentivizes people to [maximize potential all the way up to destroying themselves](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/inefficient/#:\~:text=The%20key%20thing%20about%20evolution,to%20everything%20at%20all%20times. ).他是对的，但我也有一部分可以同情那些追求效率最大化的首席执行官，因为如果他们不这样做，他们的竞争对手就会让他们破产。人类行为中有一种奇怪的怪癖，它激励人们最大限度地发挥潜力，直至摧毁自己。

So many people strive for efficient lives, where no hour is wasted. But when no hour is wasted you have no time to wander, explore something new, or let your thoughts run free – which can be some of the most productive forms of thought. Psychologist Amos Tversky once said “the secret to doing good research is always to be a little underemployed. You waste years by not being able to waste hours.” A successful person purposely leaving gaps of free time on their schedule can feel inefficient. And it is, so not many people do it.许多人都在努力追求高效的生活，在那里没有时间被浪费。但是，当没有时间被浪费的时候，你就没有时间去漫步、探索新事物，或者让你的思想自由流动——这可能是最富有成效的思想形式之一。心理学家阿莫斯·特沃斯基（Amos Tversky）曾说过：“做好研究的秘诀总是有点就业不足。你会因为不能浪费时间而浪费很多年。”一个成功的人故意在自己的日程表上留出空闲时间，可能会觉得效率低下。事实上，没有多少人这么做。

The paradox that room for error is essential to survival in the long run, but maximizing efficiency in a way that eliminates room for error can be essential to surviving the short run, is a strange one.

Those who fight it – the rare company or employee or economy willing to sacrifice short-term gain for long-term survival – are the oddballs, rarely understood, easily belittled, who underperform most of the time but survive long enough to get the last laugh, and the highest returns.与之抗争的人——愿意牺牲短期利益换取长期生存的罕见公司、员工或经济体——是那些古怪的人，很少被理解，很容易被轻视，他们在大多数情况下表现不佳，但生存的时间足够长，可以得到最后的笑声，获得最高的回报。

**8. The best story wins.**最好的故事获胜。

Not the best idea. Not the right answer. Just whoever tells a story that catches people’s attention and gets them to nod their heads.这不是最好的主意。答案不对。只要是谁讲的故事能引起人们的注意并让他们点头。

Sherlock Holmes put it: “What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence. The question is what can you make people believe you have done.”夏洛克·福尔摩斯（SherlockHolmes）说：“你在这个世界上做什么无关紧要。问题是你能让人们相信你做了什么。”

Wherever information is exchanged – wherever there are products, companies, careers, politics, knowledge, education, and culture – you will find that the best story wins. Great ideas explained poorly can go nowhere while old or wrong ideas told compellingly can ignite a revolution. Morgan Freeman can narrate a grocery list and bring people to tears, while an inarticulate scientist might cure disease and go unnoticed.无论信息交流在哪里，无论产品、公司、职业、政治、知识、教育和文化在哪里，你都会发现最好的故事是成功的。解释不当的伟大思想是行不通的，而令人信服的旧思想或错误思想则会引发一场革命。摩根·弗里曼（MorganFreeman）可以讲述一份杂货清单，让人流泪，而一个口齿不清的科学家可能治愈疾病而不被人注意。

Even when the right idea or an expert talent is at work, there’s almost always a powerful story at play.即使当正确的想法或专家才能发挥作用时，几乎总是有一个强大的故事在起作用。

Charles Darwin [didn’t discover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Russel_Wallace ) evolution, he just wrote the first and most compelling book about it. Andrew Carnegie said he was as proud of his charm and ability to befriend people as he was his business acumen. Elon Musk is as skilled at getting investors to believe a vision as he is at engineering. Rory Sutherland recently put it: “No one would have heard of Jesus if it wasn’t for Saint Paul.”查尔斯·达尔文没有发现进化论，他只是写了第一本也是最引人注目的关于进化论的书。安德鲁·卡内基（AndrewCarnegie）说，他对自己的魅力和与人交朋友的能力感到骄傲，就像他对自己的商业敏锐一样。埃隆·马斯克（ElonMusk）在让投资者相信愿景方面与他在工程方面一样娴熟。罗里·萨瑟兰（RorySutherland）最近说：“如果没有圣保罗，没有人会听说过耶稣。”

Author Elias Canette wrote:作者Elias Canette写道：

> 
  The largest crowds are drawn by the storytellers. It is around them that the people throng most densely and stay longest… their words come from further off and hang longer in the air than those of ordinary people.讲故事的人吸引了最多的人群。正是在他们周围，人们聚集得最密集，停留的时间最长……他们的话来自更远的地方，比普通人的话悬挂在空中的时间更长。

George Packer echoes the same:乔治·帕克（GeorgePacker）也回应了同样的观点：

> 
  The most durable narratives are not the ones that stand up best to fact-checking. They’re the ones that address our deepest needs and desires.最持久的叙述不是最经得起事实核查的叙述。他们是满足我们最深层需求和愿望的人。

This drives you crazy if you assume the world is swayed by facts and objectivity – if you assume the best idea wins. But it’s how people think. And it’s actually optimistic, because when you realize you can change the world by explaining an old thing in a new way vs. creating something new, you start to see so much potential.如果你认为世界被事实和客观性所左右，如果你认为最好的想法获胜，这会让你发疯。但这是人们的想法。事实上，这是乐观的，因为当你意识到你可以通过以新的方式解释旧的东西而不是创造新的东西来改变世界时，你开始看到了巨大的潜力。

**9. We are swayed by complexity when simplicity is the real mark of intelligence and understanding.**当简单是智慧和理解的真正标志时，我们被复杂所左右。

Sometimes length is necessary. When the Allies met to discuss what to do with Germany after World War II Winston Churchill noted, “We are dealing with the fate of eighty million people and that requires more than eighty minutes to consider.”有时长度是必要的。二战后，当盟国开会讨论如何应对德国时，温斯顿·丘吉尔指出：“我们正在处理8000万人的命运，这需要80多分钟来考虑。”

But computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra [once wrote](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD898.html ):但计算机科学家Edsger Dijkstra曾写道：

> 
  Simplicity is the hallmark of truth— we should know better, but complexity continues to have a morbid attraction. When you give for an academic audience a lecture that is crystal clear from alpha to omega, your audience feels cheated and leaves the lecture hall commenting to each other: “That was rather trivial, wasn’t it? The sore truth is that complexity sells better.简单是真理的标志——我们应该更清楚，但复杂性仍然具有病态的吸引力。当你为学术听众做一场从阿尔法到欧米伽都非常清晰的演讲时，你的听众会感到受骗，离开演讲厅，互相评论：“这太微不足道了，不是吗？令人痛心的事实是，复杂性卖得更好。

*The sore truth is that complexity sells better.*令人痛心的事实是，复杂性卖得更好。

Of course that’s the case.当然是这样。

A tweet can be more insightful than a book, but people pay $20 for books and would never pay a cent for thousands of tweets. Charge a client for ten sentences of advice and they’ll leave in disgust. Give them a phone-book-size elaboration and they’ll pay you a fortune and refer their friends.一条推文可能比一本书更有见地，但人们花20美元买书，永远不会花一分钱买成千上万条推文。向客户索要十句忠告，他们会厌恶地离开。给他们一个电话簿大小的详细说明，他们会给你一大笔钱，并介绍他们的朋友。

Why?为什么？

Why do complexity and length sell when simplicity and brevity will do?为什么复杂性和长度会在简单和简洁的情况下大受欢迎？

A few reasons.有几个原因。

One is that length is often the only thing signaling effort and thoughtfulness. Consumers of information rarely try to dissect an argument objectively; that’s too hard. When reading they just try to figure out whether the author is credible or not. *Does this sound right? Does it pass the smell test? Has the author put more than a few seconds of thought into this argument?* Length and complexity are often the only indication that an argument was thoughtful vs. a random gut feeling.其一是，长度往往是表示努力和周到的唯一标志。信息消费者很少试图客观地剖析论点；那太难了。阅读时，他们只是想弄清楚作者是否可信。这听起来对吗？它通过嗅觉测试了吗？作者是否对这一论点进行了几秒钟的思考？长度和复杂性往往是唯一表明一场辩论是深思熟虑的，而不是随意的直觉。

A second is that things you don’t understand create a mystique around people who do. When you understand things I don’t, I have a hard time judging the limits of your knowledge in that field, which makes me more prone to taking your views at face value.第二，你不了解的事情会在了解的人周围产生一种神秘感。当你了解我不了解的东西时，我很难判断你在该领域的知识极限，这使我更倾向于从表面上接受你的观点。

A third is that complexity gives a comforting impression of control, while simplicity is hard to distinguish from cluelessness. The more knobs you can fiddle with the more control you feel you have over the situation, because the *impression* of knowledge increases. Only paying attention to a few variables while ignoring everything else can make you look ignorant, even if it’s the right thing to do. If a client says, “What about this, what’s happening here?” and you respond, “Oh, I have no idea, I don’t look at that,” the odds that you’ll sound uninformed might outweigh the odds of indicating you’ve mastered simplicity.第三，复杂性给人一种令人欣慰的控制感，而简单性很难与无俱乐部性区分开来。你能摆弄的旋钮越多，你就越能控制局面，因为知识的印象会增加。只关注少数变量而忽视其他所有变量会让你看起来很无知，即使这样做是正确的。如果一个客户说，“这怎么了，这里发生了什么？”你回答说，“哦，我不知道，我不看这个。”你听起来不了解情况的可能性可能会超过表明你已经掌握了简单性的可能性。

**10. Your willingness to believe a prediction is influenced by how much you want or need that prediction to be true.**你相信某个预测的意愿受你希望或需要该预测成真的程度的影响。

What was the happiest day of your life?你一生中最快乐的一天是什么？

The documentary *How to Live Forever* asks that innocent question to a centenarian who offered an amazing response.纪录片《如何永生》向一位百岁老人提出了这个天真的问题，这位百岁老人给出了惊人的回答。

“Armistice Day,” she said, referring to the 1918 agreement that ended World War I.她说：“停战日”，指的是1918年结束第一次世界大战的协议。

“Why?” the producer asks.“为什么？”制片人问道。

“Because we knew there would be no more wars ever again,” she says.“因为我们知道不会再有战争了，”她说。

World War II began 21 years later, killing 75 million people.21年后，第二次世界大战开始，造成7500万人死亡。

There are so many things in life that we think are true because we desperately want them to be true. People do this with their relationships, careers, investments, political views – anything forward-looking is subject to being swayed by your desire to have a pleasant life.生活中有太多我们认为是真的事情，因为我们迫切希望它们是真的。人们会通过他们的关系、职业、投资、政治观点来实现这一点——任何有前瞻性的事情都会受到你对快乐生活的渴望的影响。

Everyone is a dreamer because it’s hard to go about your day when you genuinely believe the future will be difficult. An appealing fiction – believing in the outcome you want even if it’s unlikely to come true – is often the only comfort in an uncertain world.每个人都是一个梦想家，因为当你真的相信未来会很困难的时候，你很难继续你的一天。一部吸引人的小说——相信你想要的结果，即使它不太可能实现——往往是在一个不确定的世界中唯一的安慰。

The higher the stakes, the truer this becomes. Before modern medicine came centuries of blood-letting, starvation therapy, cutting holes in your body to let the evils out, and other treatments that made everything worse but gave people a little hope that it *could* work. If you desperately need a solution and a good one isn’t known or readily available to you, the path of least resistance is willingness to believe anything. Not just try anything, but believe it.赌注越高，情况就越真实。在现代医学出现之前的几个世纪里，放血、饥饿疗法、在身体上挖洞以释放邪恶，以及其他使一切变得更糟但却给人们带来了一点希望的治疗方法。如果你迫切需要一个解决方案，而你不知道或不容易找到一个好的解决方案，那么阻力最小的途径就是愿意相信任何事情。不只是尝试任何事情，而是相信它。

The same thing happens in investing, when people eagerly listen to forecasters whose track record is indistinguishable from guessing. Same in politics. The more uncertain the endeavor, and the higher the stakes of the outcome, the more you are persuaded by the most pleasing answer. And if you tell people what they want to hear you can be wrong indefinitely without penalty.同样的事情也发生在投资上，当人们急切地听取预测者的意见时，他们的记录与猜测是无法区分的。政治上也是如此。努力的不确定性越大，结果的风险越高，你越会被最令人愉悦的答案所说服。如果你告诉人们他们想听什么，你可能会无限期地犯错，而不会受到惩罚。

**11. It’s hard to empathize with other people’s beliefs if they’ve experienced parts of the world you have not.**11、如果别人经历过你没有经历过的世界，那么很难理解他们的信仰。

Jason Zweig of the *Wall Street Journal* [wrote](https://www.wsj.com/articles/knowing-if-you-can-stomach-the-next-big-market-swing-11567782137 ) last week:《华尔街日报》的贾森·茨威格上周写道：

> 
  If I ask you in a questionnaire whether you are afraid of snakes, you might say no. If I throw a live snake in your lap and then ask if you’re afraid of snakes, you’ll probably say yes—if you ever talk to me again.如果我在问卷中问你是否害怕蛇，你可能会说不。如果我把一条活蛇扔在你的膝盖上，然后问你是否害怕蛇，如果你再跟我说话，你可能会说是的。

The gap between how you feel as an outsider vs. how you feel when you’re experiencing something firsthand can be a mile wide.作为一个局外人，你的感受与你亲身体验事物时的感受之间的差距可能有一英里宽。

There are theories that big wars tend to happen 20-40 years apart because that’s the amount of time it takes to cycle through a new generation of voters, politicians, and generals who aren’t scarred by the last war. Other political trends – social rights, economic theories, budget priorities – follow a similar path.有理论认为，大规模战争往往会间隔20-40年发生，因为这是新一代选民、政治家和将军们在没有被上次战争伤痕累累的情况下循环所需的时间。其他政治趋势——社会权利、经济理论、预算优先事项——也遵循类似的路径。

It’s not that people forget. It’s that empathy and open-mindedness cannot recreate what genuine fear and uncertainty feel like.并不是人们忘记了。这是因为同理心和开放的心态无法重现真正的恐惧和不确定性。

My guess is that more than half of all disagreements – personal, domestic, international, financial – would disappear if you could see the world through the lens of your opponent, and had experienced what they have in life.

Nassim Taleb summarizes this well when he says, “If something looks irrational – and has been so for a long time – odds are you have a wrong definition of rationality.”纳西姆·塔勒布（NassimTaleb）总结了这一点，他说：“如果某件事看起来不合理——而且这种情况已经存在很长时间了——那么很可能你对理性的定义是错误的。”

A few questions everyone should ask themselves:每个人都应该问自己几个问题：

*Which of my current views would I disagree with if I were born in a different country or generation?*如果我出生在另一个国家或一代人，我会不同意我目前的哪些观点？

*What haven’t I experienced firsthand that leaves me naive to how something works?*我还没有亲身经历过什么让我对事情的运作方式感到幼稚？

*What is a problem that I think only applies to other countries/industries/careers that will eventually impact me?*我认为什么问题只适用于其他国家/行业/职业，最终会影响我？

But they’re impossible to answer completely. So everyone’s a little bit blind to how the world works, and when they think they’re disagreeing with someone else they’re actually just uncovering an experience they haven’t had.但他们不可能完全回答。所以每个人都对这个世界的运作方式有点盲目，当他们认为自己与别人意见不同时，实际上只是在揭示一种他们从未有过的经历。

**12. An innocent denial of your own flaws, caused by the ability to justify your mistakes in your own head in a way you can’t do for others.**12、无辜地否认自己的缺陷，这是因为你有能力在自己的头脑中为自己的错误辩护，而你却无法为他人辩护。

George Carlin once [joked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rh6qqsmxNs&amp;ab_channel=Mentat99 ) how easy it is to spot stupid people. “Carry a little pad and pencil around with you. You’ll wind up with 30 or 40 names by the end of the day. It doesn’t take long to spot one of them, does it? Takes about eight seconds.”乔治·卡林（GeorgeCarlin）曾开玩笑说，发现愚蠢的人是多么容易。“随身携带一个小本子和铅笔。到一天结束时，你会得到30到40个名字。找到其中一个名字不需要多长时间，是吗？大约需要8秒钟。”

Like most comedy it’s funny because it’s true.像大多数喜剧一样，它很有趣，因为它是真的。

But Daniel Kahneman mentions a more important truth in his book, *Thinking, Fast and Slow*: “It is easier to recognize other people’s mistakes than our own.”但丹尼尔·卡尼曼（DanielKahneman）在他的书《思考，快与慢》中提到了一个更重要的事实：“认识别人的错误比认识自己的错误更容易。”

I would add my own theory: It’s easier to blame other people’s mistakes on stupidity and greed than our own.我想补充一下我自己的理论：把别人的错误归咎于愚蠢和贪婪比我们自己的更容易。

That’s because when you make a mistake, I judge it solely based on what I see. It’s quick and easy.那是因为当你犯错误时，我只根据我所看到的来判断。它既快又简单。

But when I make a mistake there’s a long and persuasive monologue in my head that justifies bad decisions and adds important context other people don’t see.但当我犯错误时，脑海中会有一段很长很有说服力的独白，为错误的决定辩护，并添加其他人看不到的重要背景。

Everyone’s like that. It’s normal.每个人都是这样的。这很正常。

Here’s a big reason this occurs: My brother-in-law, a social worker, recently told me, “All behavior makes sense with enough information.”发生这种情况的一个重要原因是：我的社会工作者姐夫最近告诉我，“只要有足够的信息，所有的行为都是有意义的。”

It’s such a good point.这是一个很好的观点。

You see someone doing something crazy and think, “Why in the world would you do that?” Then you sit down with them, hear about their life, and after a while you realize, “Ah, I kind of get it now.”你看到有人在做一些疯狂的事情，就会想，“你到底为什么要这么做？”然后你和他们坐下来，听听他们的生活，过了一会儿你就会意识到，“啊，我现在有点明白了。”

Everyone is a product of their own life experiences, few of which are visible or known to other people.每个人都是自己生活经历的产物，很少有人能看到或知道这些经历。

What makes sense to me might not make sense to you because you don’t know what kind of experiences have shaped me and vice versa.对我有意义的事情可能对你没有意义，因为你不知道什么样的经历塑造了我，反之亦然。

The question, *“Why don’t you agree with me?”* can have infinite answers.“你为什么不同意我的观点？”可以有无限的答案。

Sometimes one side is selfish, or stupid, or blind, or uninformed.

But usually a better question is, “*What have you experienced that I haven’t that would make you believe what you do? And would I think about the world like you do if I experienced what you have?”*但通常一个更好的问题是，“你经历过哪些我没有经历过的事情会让你相信你所做的？如果我经历了你所经历的，我会像你一样思考这个世界吗？”

It’s the question that contains the most answers of why people don’t agree with each other.这个问题包含了人们为什么不同意对方的大多数答案。

But it’s such a hard question to ask. It’s uncomfortable to think that what you haven’t experienced might change what you believe because it’s admitting your own ignorance. It’s much easier, and common, to assume those who disagree with you aren’t thinking as hard as you are – especially when judging others’ mistakes.但这是一个很难问的问题。认为你没有经历过的事情可能会改变你的信仰，这是令人不安的，因为这是承认你自己的无知。假设那些与你意见不同的人没有像你那样认真思考，尤其是在判断别人的错误时，这要容易得多，也很常见。

**13. An underappreciation for how small things compound into extraordinary things.**13、对小事如何合成非凡事物的认识不足。

The most astounding force in the universe is obvious. It’s evolution. The thing that guided single-cell organisms into a human who can read this article on an iPhone with 500 gigs of storage. The thing that’s responsible for 20/20 vision and flying birds and immune systems. Nothing else in science can blow your mind more than what evolution has accomplished.宇宙中最惊人的力量是显而易见的。这是进化。将单细胞有机体引导到一个人身上的东西，这个人可以在有500 Gig存储空间的iPhone上阅读这篇文章。负责20/20视力、飞鸟和免疫系统的东西。在科学领域，没有什么比进化所取得的成就更让人震惊的了。

Biologist Leslie Orgel used to say, “evolution is cleverer than you are” because whenever a critic says, “evolution could never do that” they usually just lacked imagination.生物学家莱斯利·奥尔格尔（LeslieOrgel）曾说过，“进化比你聪明”，因为每当评论家说，“进化永远不会做到这一点”，他们通常只是缺乏想象力。

It’s also easy to underestimate because of basic math.由于基础数学的原因，这也很容易被低估。

Evolution’s superpower is not just selecting favorable traits. That part is so tedious, and if it’s all you focus on you’ll be skeptical and confused. Most species’ change in any millennia is so trivial it’s unnoticeable.进化的超级力量不仅仅是选择有利的特性。这部分内容太枯燥了，如果你只关注它，你会感到怀疑和困惑。在任何千年中，大多数物种的变化都是如此微不足道，以至于无法察觉。

The real magic of evolution is that it’s been selecting traits for 3.8 billion years.进化的真正魔力在于它已经选择了38亿年的性状。

The time, not the little changes, is what moves the needle. Take minuscule changes and compound them by 3.8 billion years and you get results that are indistinguishable from magic.打针的是时间，而不是微小的变化。以微小的变化和38亿年的复合变化为例，你会得到与魔法无法区分的结果。

That’s the real lesson from evolution: If you have a big number in the exponent slot you do not need extraordinary change to deliver extraordinary results. It’s not intuitive, but it’s so powerful. “The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function,” physicist Albert Bartlett used to say.这是进化的真正教训：如果指数槽中有一个很大的数字，则不需要进行非常大的更改来产生非常大的结果。这不是直观的，但它很强大。物理学家阿尔伯特·巴特利特（AlbertBartlett）曾说过：“人类最大的缺点是无法理解指数函数。”。

A lot of things work like that.很多事情都是这样的。

I have heard many people say the first time they saw a compound interest table – or one of those stories about how much more you’d have for retirement if you began saving in your 20s vs. your 30s – changed their life. But it probably didn’t. What it likely did was *surprise* them, because the results intuitively didn’t seem right. Linear thinking is so much more intuitive than exponential thinking. Michael Batnick once explained it. If I ask you to calculate 8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8 in your head, you can do it in a few seconds (it’s 72). If I ask you to calculate 8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8, your head will explode (it’s 134,217,728).我听到很多人说，他们第一次看到复利表——或者其中一个故事，如果你在20多岁时开始储蓄，那么你的退休收入会比30多岁时多多少——改变了他们的生活。但它可能没有。它可能会让他们感到惊讶，因为从直觉上看，结果似乎并不正确。线性思维比指数思维更直观。迈克尔·巴特尼克曾经解释过这一点。如果我让你在脑子里计算8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8，你可以在几秒钟内完成（72）。如果我让你计算8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8，你的头会爆炸（134217728）。

A common area we see this shortcoming in action is investing.我们在行动中看到这一缺点的一个共同领域是投资。

Howard Marks [once talked about](https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/70790270/marks-embracing-the-psychology-of-investing?tab=transcript ) an investor whose annual results were never ranked in the top quartile, but over a 14-year period he was in the top 4% of all investors. If he keeps those mediocre returns up for another 10 years he may be in the top 1% of his peers – one of the greatest of his generation despite being unmentionable in any given year.霍华德·马克斯（HowardMarks）曾谈到一位投资者，他的年度业绩从未排在前四分之一，但在14年的时间里，他在所有投资者中排名前4%。如果他再把这些平庸的回报保持10年，他可能会在同龄人中名列前茅，成为他这一代人中最伟大的一个，尽管在任何一年都无人提及。

So much focus in investing is on what people can do right now, this year, maybe next year. “What are the best returns I can earn?” seems like such an intuitive question to ask.所以投资的重点是人们现在、今年或明年能做什么。“我能获得的最佳回报是什么？”这似乎是一个很直观的问题。

But like evolution, that’s not where the magic happens.但就像进化一样，这不是魔法发生的地方。

If you understand the math behind compounding you realize the most important question is not “How can I earn the highest returns?” It’s, “What are the best returns I can sustain for the longest period of time?”如果你理解复合背后的数学原理，你就会意识到最重要的问题不是“我如何才能获得最高回报？”问题是，“在最长的时间内，我能维持的最佳回报是什么？”

That’s the big lesson from compounding: Less focus on change, more focus on the exponent.这就是复合的重要教训：少关注变化，多关注指数。

**14. The gap between knowing what to do and actually getting people to do it can be enormous.**14、知道该做什么和实际让人们去做之间的差距可能是巨大的。

I once asked a doctor: What’s the hardest part of your job?我曾经问过一位医生：你工作中最困难的部分是什么？



It wasn’t the stress or responsibility. It was so basic. “Getting my patients to do what I ask of them,” she said.这不是压力或责任。它是如此的基本。“让我的病人按照我的要求去做，”她说。

I didn’t understand at first, but it made sense when she explained.起初我不明白，但当她解释时，这是有道理的。

“You have an appointment with a patient and you say, ‘I need you to get this lab done, see this specialist, pick up this medicine.’ And they come back a month later and they haven’t done any of it.” They either couldn’t afford it, or it was too intimidating, or they didn’t have time.“你和一个病人有预约，你说，‘我需要你做这个实验室，看这个专家，拿这个药。’一个月后他们回来了，但他们什么都没做。”他们要么负担不起，要么太吓人，要么没有时间。

She explained that becoming a better doctor meant spending more time managing her patients rather than managing those patients’ illnesses. There is a huge difference, she said, between an expert in medicine and an expert in healthcare.她解释说，成为一名更好的医生意味着要花更多的时间管理患者，而不是管理患者的疾病。她说，医学专家和医疗保健专家之间存在着巨大的差异。

An expert in medicine knows all the right answers out of the textbook. They can diagnose with precision and are up to date on all the latest treatments.医学专家知道课本上的所有正确答案。他们可以精确诊断，并掌握最新的治疗方法。

An expert in healthcare understands that medicine from the patient’s view is intimidating, confusing, expensive, and time-consuming. Nothing you diagnose or prescribe matters until you’ve addressed that reality with patients, because even a perfect solution makes no difference to the patient who doesn’t follow it.一位医疗专家明白，从患者的角度来看，药物是可怕的、令人困惑的、昂贵的和耗时的。在你解决了患者的现实问题之前，你所诊断的或开出的处方都不重要，因为即使是完美的解决方案，对不遵循它的患者也没有什么区别。

So many things in life work like that. Investing, relationships, health, careers. In each, what we *should* do isn’t that hard – it’s actually doing it that requires moving mountains.生活中很多事情都是这样的。投资、人际关系、健康、职业。在每一种情况下，我们应该做的并不是那么难——实际上，这需要移山。

In many cases this is caused by the appeal of hacks – shortcuts and tricks to get what you want without paying the price. The patient doesn’t want to eat better and exercise; they want a pill to fix everything. The investor doesn’t want to wait a decade for their money to compound; they want a stock that will double next week.在许多情况下，这是由黑客的吸引力造成的——不付出代价就能得到你想要的东西的捷径和技巧。患者不想吃得更好，也不想锻炼；他们想要一颗药丸来解决一切问题。投资者不想等待十年，让他们的资金复利；他们想要一支下周翻倍的股票。

But the real world abhors hacks, and [rather than an easy win](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/useful-hacks/ ) those who pursue them are often charged punitive damages. So we live in a world where solutions to problems can be shockingly simple but getting people to follow simple advice can be astoundingly difficult.但现实世界痛恨黑客，追查黑客的人往往会受到惩罚性赔偿，而不是轻易取胜。因此，我们生活在一个解决问题的方法极其简单的世界里，但让人们听从简单的建议却极其困难。

Issac Asimov said, “Science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom,” which sums up a lot of things quite well.艾萨克·阿西莫夫（IssacAsimov）说：“科学收集知识的速度快于社会收集智慧的速度”，这很好地概括了很多事情。

**15. We’re bad at imagining how change will feel because there’s no context in dreams.**我们不善于想象改变的感觉，因为梦中没有上下文。

Everyone thinks they have a high risk tolerance when things are going great. Then things turn down and they say, “Ah, you know, actually, this hurts more than I thought.”当事情进展顺利时，每个人都认为自己有很高的风险承受能力。然后事情变糟了，他们说，“啊，你知道，事实上，这比我想象的更痛。”

When thinking about future risks you tend to think in isolation. If I think about a 40% market decline, I imagine everything in the world being the same except stocks being 40% cheaper. That doesn’t feel so bad. But the reason stocks fall 40% cheaper is probably because people think the world is falling apart – a brutal recession, a pandemic, a political meltdown, whatever. The stress of that is much harder to think about until it happens.在考虑未来风险时，你倾向于孤立地思考。如果我想到市场下跌40%，我想世界上的一切都是一样的，除了股票便宜40%。感觉还不错。但股市下跌40%的原因可能是因为人们认为世界正在分崩离析——一场残酷的衰退、一场流行病、一场政治崩溃，等等。在它发生之前，这种压力很难想象。

The same thing happens when we’re imagining a gain.同样的事情也发生在我们想象收益的时候。

I don’t think I’ve met, or know of, anyone with outsized success who gained as much happiness as an outsider might expect. That doesn’t mean success can’t bring pride or contentment or independence. But it’s rarely what you thought it would be before achieving it.我不认为我遇到过，也不知道有谁取得了巨大的成功，却获得了局外人所期望的那么多幸福。这并不意味着成功不能带来骄傲、满足或独立。但在实现它之前，它很少是你想象的那样。

Jim Carrey once said, “I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that it’s not the answer.”吉姆·凯瑞曾经说过：“我认为每个人都应该变得富有和出名，做他们曾经梦想过的一切，这样他们就能明白这不是答案。”

I think part is the same reason predicting loss is difficult: It’s hard to imagine the full context.我认为部分原因是预测损失很困难的原因：很难想象完整的背景。

If you think of your future self living in a new mansion, you imagine basking in splendor and everything feeling great. What’s easy to forget is that people in mansions can get the flu, have psoriasis, become embroiled in lawsuits, bicker with their spouses, are wracked with insecurity and annoyed with politicians – which in any given moment can supersede any joy that comes from material success. Future fortunes are imagined in a vacuum, but reality is always lived with the good and bad taken together, competing for attention.如果你想到自己将来住在一座新的豪宅里，你会想象自己沐浴在辉煌之中，一切都感觉很棒。人们很容易忘记的是，住在豪宅的人可能会患流感、牛皮癣、卷入诉讼、与配偶争吵、被不安全感折磨、对政客感到恼火，而在任何特定时刻，这些都可能取代任何来自物质成功的喜悦。未来的命运是在真空中想象出来的，但现实总是生活在好与坏的一起，争夺注意力。

**16. We are blind to how fragile the world is due to a poor understanding of rare events.**由于对罕见事件缺乏了解，我们对世界的脆弱程度视而不见。

John Littlewood was a mathematician who sought to debunk the idea of miracles being anything more than simple statistics.约翰·利特伍德（JohnLittlewood）是一位数学家，他试图揭穿奇迹不仅仅是简单统计数字的观点。

Physicist Freeman Dyson explains:物理学家弗里曼·戴森解释道：

> 
  Littlewood’s law of miracles states that in the course of any normal person’s life, miracles happen at the rate of roughly one per month.Littlewood奇迹定律指出，在任何正常人的一生中，奇迹大约每月发生一次。

  The proof of the law is simple. During the time that we are awake and actively engaged in living our lives, roughly for eight hours each day, we see and hear things happening at a rate of one per second. So the total number of events that happen to us is about 30,000 per day, or about a million per month.法律的证明很简单。在我们清醒并积极参与生活的过程中，大约每天八小时，我们以每秒一次的速度看到和听到事情的发生。因此，发生在我们身上的事件总数约为每天30000起，或每月约100万起。

  With few exceptions, these events are not miracles because they are insignificant. The chance of a miracle is about one per million events. Therefore we should expect about one miracle to happen, on average, every month.除了少数例外，这些事件都不是奇迹，因为它们无关紧要。奇迹发生的几率约为百万分之一。因此，我们应该预计平均每个月会发生一次奇迹。

The idea that incredible things happen because of boring statistics is important, because it’s true for terrible things too.令人难以置信的事情之所以发生，是因为无聊的统计数据，这一点很重要，因为可怕的事情也是如此。

Think about 100-year events. One-hundred-year floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, financial crises, frauds, pandemics, political meltdowns, economic recessions, and so on endlessly. Lots of terrible things can be called “100-year events”.想想100年来发生的事情。百年一遇的洪水、飓风、地震、金融危机、欺诈、流行病、政治崩溃、经济衰退等等层出不穷。许多可怕的事情可以称为“百年大事”。

A 100-year event doesn’t mean it happens every 100 years. It means there’s about a 1% chance of it occurring in any given year. That seems low. But when there are hundreds of different independent 100-year events, what are the odds that any one of them will occur in a given year?一个100年的事件并不意味着它每100年发生一次。这意味着在任何一年中都有大约1%的几率发生这种情况。这似乎很低。但是，当有数百个不同的独立100年事件时，其中任何一个事件在给定年份发生的几率有多大？

Pretty good, in fact.事实上，相当不错。

If next year there’s a 1% chance of a new disastrous pandemic, a 1% chance of a crippling depression, a 1% chance of a catastrophic flood, a 1% chance of political collapse, and on and on, then the odds that something bad will happen next year – or any year – are … uncomfortably high.如果明年有百分之一的几率发生新的灾难性流行病，百分之一的几率发生严重的抑郁症，百分之一的几率发生灾难性洪水，百分之一的几率发生政治崩溃，等等，那么明年或任何一年发生坏事的几率……都非常高。

Littlewood’s Law tells us to expect a miracle every month. The flip side is to expect a disaster roughly as often.Littlewood定律告诉我们每个月都要期待奇迹的发生。另一方面，预计灾难的发生频率大致相同。

Which is what history tells us, isn’t it?这就是历史告诉我们的，不是吗？

History is “just one damn thing after another,” said Arnold Toynbee. Dan Carlin’s book The End is Always Near highlights periods – from pandemics to nuclear war – where it felt like the world was coming to an end. They exist in every era, every continent, every culture. Bad news is the norm.阿诺德·汤因比（ArnoldToynbee）说，历史“只是一件又一件该死的事情”。丹·卡林（DanCarlin）的书《末日总是近在眼前》（The End is Always Near）强调了从流行病到核战争的各个时期，人们感觉世界即将走向末日。它们存在于每个时代、每个大陆、每个文化中。坏消息是常态。

Even during what we remember as prosperous periods, like the 1950s and 1990s, there was a continuous chain of grief. Adjusted for population growth, more Americans lost their jobs during the 1958 recession than did in any single month during the Great Recession of 2008. The global financial system nearly fell apart in 1998, during the greatest prosperity boom we’ve ever seen.即使在我们记忆中的繁荣时期，比如20世纪50年代和90年代，也有一连串的悲伤。考虑到人口增长，1958年经济衰退期间失去工作的美国人比2008年大衰退期间任何一个月都要多。1998年，在我们所见过的最大繁荣时期，全球金融体系几乎崩溃。

The world breaks about once every ten years, on average. For your country, state, town, or business, once every one to three years is probably more common.世界平均每十年一次。对于您的国家、州、镇或企业，每一到三年一次可能更常见。

Sometimes it feels like terrible luck, or that bad news has new momentum. More often it’s just Littlewood’s Law at work. A zillion different things can go wrong, so at least one of them is likely to be causing havoc in any given moment.有时感觉运气不好，或者坏消息有了新的势头。更多的时候，这只是工作中的利特尔伍德定律。无数不同的事情可能会出错，因此在任何特定时刻，其中至少有一件可能会造成严重破坏。

**17. The inability to accept hassle, nonsense, and inefficiency frustrates people who can’t accept how the world works.**无法接受纷争、胡说八道和效率低下，让那些无法接受世界运转方式的人感到沮丧。

Steven Pressfield wrote for 30 years before publishing *The Legend of Bagger Vance*. His career leading up to then was bleak, at one point living in a halfway house because it had cheap rent.史蒂芬·普雷斯菲尔德在出版《巴格·万斯传奇》之前写了30年书。在那之前，他的职业生涯很黯淡，曾一度因为租金便宜而住在一所中途之家。

He once spoke about the people he met [living there:](https://tim.blog/2021/02/27/steven-pressfield-transcript/ )他曾经谈到他在那里遇到的人：

> 
  The people in this halfway house, we used to hang out in the kitchen and talk all night long, were among the smartest people that I ever met and the funniest and the most interesting.我们过去常常在厨房里闲逛，聊上一整晚，在这个中途之家里的人是我见过的最聪明、最有趣、最有趣的人。

  And what I concluded from hanging out with them and from others in a similar situation was that they weren’t crazy at all. They were actually the smart people who had seen through the bullshit. And because of that, they couldn’t function in the world.我从与他们以及其他处于类似情况的人的交往中得出的结论是，他们一点也不疯狂。他们其实是聪明人，他们看透了这些胡说八道。正因为如此，它们无法在这个世界上发挥作用。

  They couldn’t hold a job because they just couldn’t take the bullshit, and that was how they wound up in institutions. The greater society thought, “Well these people are absolute rejects. They can’t fit in.” But in fact they were actually the people that really saw through everything.他们找不到工作，因为他们就是受不了这些胡说八道，这就是他们最终进入机构的原因。大社会认为，“这些人是绝对的弃儿，他们无法融入社会。”但事实上，他们是真正看透一切的人。

This may not have been Pressfield’s point, but it reminds of something I’ve long believed, and an insight into how so many people think.这可能不是Pressfield的观点，但它让我想起了我长期以来所相信的一些事情，以及对这么多人的想法的洞察。

If you recognize that BS is ubiquitous, then the question is not “How can I avoid all of it?” but, “What is the optimal amount to put up with so I can still function in a messy and imperfect world?”如果你认识到BS无处不在，那么问题就不是“我怎样才能避免所有这些？”但是，“为了让我在一个混乱和不完美的世界中仍能发挥作用，需要忍受的最佳数量是多少？”

If your tolerance is zero – if you are allergic to differences in opinion, personal incentives, emotions, inefficiencies, miscommunication and such – your odds of succeeding in anything that requires other people rounds to zero. You can’t function in the world, as Pressfield says.如果你的容忍度为零——如果你对意见、个人激励、情绪、效率低下、沟通失误等方面的差异过敏——那么你在任何需要其他人的事情上取得成功的几率都为零。正如Pressfield所说，你无法在这个世界上发挥作用。

I’ll tell you: So many people don’t have enough tolerance for BS. Maybe they’re not at the level Pressfield describes. But there’s a gap between their expectations and the reality of how the world works.我告诉你：这么多人对废话没有足够的容忍度。也许他们没有达到Pressfield描述的水平。但他们的期望与世界运转的现实之间存在差距。

The thing people miss is that there are bad things that become bigger problems when you try to eliminate them. I think the most successful people recognize when a certain amount of acceptance beats purity.人们错过的是，当你试图消除一些不好的东西时，它们会变成更大的问题。我认为最成功的人会意识到当某种程度的接受战胜了纯洁。

Theft is a good example. A grocery store could eliminate theft by strip-searching every customer leaving the store. But then no one would shop there. So the optimal level of theft is never zero. You accept a certain level as an inevitable cost of progress.盗窃就是一个很好的例子。杂货店可以通过对每一位离开商店的顾客进行脱衣搜查来消除盗窃行为。但是没有人会在那里购物。因此，最佳盗窃水平永远不会为零。你接受一定程度的进步是不可避免的代价。

A unique skill, an underrated skill, is identifying the optimal amount of hassle and nonsense you should put up with to get ahead while getting along.一项独特的技能，一项被低估的技能，就是找出你在相处中应该忍受的最大量的麻烦和胡说八道。

Franklin Roosevelt – the most powerful man in the world whose paralysis meant the aides often had to carry him to the bathroom – once said, “If you can’t use your legs and they bring you milk when you want orange juice, you learn to say ‘that’s all right,’ and drink it.”富兰克林·罗斯福（FranklinRoosevelt）是世界上最有权势的人，他的瘫痪意味着助手们经常不得不把他抬到浴室。他曾说过：“如果你不能用你的腿，他们会在你想要橙汁的时候给你送牛奶，你就要学会说‘没关系’，然后喝。”

Every industry and career is different, but there’s universal value in that mentality, accepting hassle when reality demands it.每个行业和职业都是不同的，但这种心态有着普遍的价值，在现实需要的时候接受麻烦。
