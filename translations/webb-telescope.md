The James Webb Space Telescope has been designed to answer many of the core questions that have animated astronomers over the past half-century. With a $10 billion price tag, it is one of the most ambitious engineering initiatives ever attempted. But for it to achieve its potential — nothing less than to rewrite the history of the cosmos and reshape humanity’s position within it — a lot of things have to work just right.

To look back in time at the cosmos’s infancy and witness the first stars flicker on, you must first grind a mirror as big as a house. Its surface must be so smooth that, if the mirror were the scale of a continent, it would feature no hill or valley greater than ankle height. Only a mirror so huge and smooth can collect and focus the faint light coming from the farthest galaxies in the sky — light that left its source long ago and therefore shows the galaxies as they appeared in the ancient past, when the universe was young. The very faintest, farthest galaxies we would see still in the process of being born, when mysterious forces conspired in the dark and the first crops of stars started to shine.&nbsp;为了及时回顾宇宙的幼年时期，见证第一颗星星闪烁，你必须首先打磨一个像房子一样大的镜子。它的表面必须非常光滑，如果镜子是一个大陆的尺度，那么它不会有超过脚踝高度的山丘或山谷。只有如此巨大而光滑的镜子才能收集和聚焦来自天空中最远星系的微弱光线，这些光线在很久以前就离开了它的来源，因此显示的是古代宇宙还年轻时出现的星系。我们所能看到的最暗、最远的星系仍在诞生过程中，当时神秘的力量在黑暗中密谋，首批恒星开始发光。&nbsp;

But to read that early chapter in the universe’s history — to learn the nature of those first, probably gargantuan stars, to learn about the invisible matter whose gravity coaxed them into being, and about the roles of magnetism and turbulence, and how enormous black holes grew and worked their way into galaxies’ centers — an exceptional mirror is not nearly enough.但要阅读宇宙历史早期的那一章——要了解那些最早的、可能是巨大恒星的性质，要了解引力引导它们形成的不可见物质，要了解磁性和湍流的作用，要了解巨大的黑洞是如何生长并进入星系中心的——一个特殊的镜子还远远不够。

The reason no one has seen the epoch of galaxy formation is that the ancient starlight, after traveling to us through the expanding fabric of space for so many billions of years, has become stretched. Ultraviolet and visible light spewed by the farthest stars in the sky stretched to around 20-times-longer wavelengths during the journey here, becoming infrared radiation. But infrared light is the kind of atom-jiggling light we refer to as heat, the same heat that radiates from our bodies and the atmosphere and the ground beneath our feet. Alas, these local heat sources swamp the pitiful flames of primeval stars. To perceive those stars, the telescope with its big perfect mirror has to be very cold. It must be launched into space.&nbsp;没有人见过星系形成的时代，是因为远古的星光在穿过不断膨胀的空间结构向我们传播了数十亿年之后，已经被拉长了。在这段旅程中，天空中最远的恒星发出的紫外线和可见光的波长延长了约20倍，成为红外辐射。但红外光是一种原子抖动的光，我们称之为热，即从我们的身体、大气层和脚下的地面辐射出来的热量。唉，这些局部热源淹没了原始恒星可怜的火焰。为了观察这些恒星，带着完美大镜子的望远镜必须非常冷。它必须发射到太空。&nbsp;

The catch is that a house-size mirror is too large to fit in any rocket fairing. The mirror, then, must be able to fold up. A mirror can only fold if it’s segmented — if, instead of a single, uninterrupted surface, it’s a honeycomb array of mirror segments. But in order to collectively create sharp images, the mirror segments, after autonomously unfolding in space, must be in virtually perfect alignment. Spectacularly precise motors are needed to achieve a good focus — motors that can nudge each mirror segment by increments of half the width of a virus until they’re all in place.问题是房子大小的镜子太大，无法安装在任何火箭整流罩中。那么，镜子必须能够折叠起来。镜子只有在被分割的情况下才能折叠——如果它不是一个单一的、不间断的表面，而是一个由镜段组成的蜂窝状阵列。但为了共同创造出清晰的图像，镜像片段在空间中自动展开后，必须处于几乎完美的对齐状态。为了获得良好的对焦效果，需要使用极其精密的马达，这种马达可以以病毒宽度的一半为增量推动每个镜像片段，直到它们全部就位。

The ability to see faint infrared sources doesn’t just grant you access to the universe’s formative chapter — roughly the period from 50 million to 500 million years after the Big Bang — it would reveal other, arguably just as significant aspects of the cosmos as well, from properties of Earth-size planets orbiting other stars to the much-contested rate at which space is expanding. But for the telescope to work, one more element is required, beyond a flawless mirror that autonomously unfolds and focuses after being shot into the sky.&nbsp;看到微弱红外源的能力不仅能让你进入宇宙形成的篇章——大约是宇宙大爆炸后5000万至5亿年的时期——它还将揭示宇宙的其他方面，可以说同样重要的方面，从环绕其他恒星的地球大小行星的性质到备受争议的空间扩张速度。但要让望远镜工作，除了一个完美的镜子之外，还需要一个元素，这个镜子在射入天空后可以自动展开和聚焦。&nbsp;

Even in outer space, the Earth, moon and sun all still heat the telescope too much for it to perceive the dim twinkle of the most distant structures in the cosmos. Unless, that is, the telescope heads for a particular spot four times farther away from Earth than the moon called Lagrange point 2. There, the moon, Earth and sun all lie in the same direction, letting the telescope block out all three bodies at once by erecting a tennis court-size sunshield. Shaded in this way, the telescope can finally enter a deep chill and at long last detect the feeble heat of the cosmic dawn.&nbsp;即使在外层空间，地球、月球和太阳仍然对望远镜加热过多，使其无法感知宇宙中最遥远结构的微弱闪烁。除非，也就是说，望远镜指向一个距离地球四倍于月球的特定点，称为拉格朗日点2。在那里，月亮、地球和太阳都位于同一个方向，通过架设一个网球场大小的遮阳板，望远镜可以同时阻挡所有三个天体。通过这种方式遮蔽，望远镜最终可以进入一种深冷，并最终探测到宇宙黎明的微弱热量。&nbsp;

The sunshield is both an infrared telescope’s only hope and its Achilles heel.遮阳板既是红外望远镜的唯一希望，也是它的致命弱点。

In order to unfurl to large enough proportions without weighing down a rocket, the sunshield must consist of thin fabric. (The whole observatory, for that matter, including its mirrors, cameras and other instruments, its transmitters and its power sources, must have only about 2% of the typical mass of a large ground-based telescope.) Nothing about building a giant yet lightweight infrared-sensing spacecraft is easy, but the unavoidable use of fabric makes it an inherently risky affair. Fabric is, engineers say, “nondeterministic,” its movements impossible to perfectly control or predict. If the sunshield snags as it unfurls, the whole telescope will turn into space junk.&nbsp;为了在不压下火箭的情况下展开足够大的比例，遮阳板必须由薄薄的织物组成。（就这一点而言，整个天文台，包括其镜子、相机和其他仪器、发射器和电源，必须只有大型地基望远镜典型质量的2%左右。）建造一艘巨大而轻巧的红外传感航天器绝非易事，但不可避免地要使用织物，这本身就是一件危险的事情。工程师说，织物“不确定”，其运动不可能完全控制或预测。如果遮光罩在展开时卡住，整个望远镜将变成太空垃圾。&nbsp;

Currently, the telescope — which has, incredibly, been built — is folded up and ready to be placed atop an Ariane 5 rocket. The rocket is scheduled for liftoff from Kourou, French Guiana, on December 22, more than 30 years after its payload, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), was first envisioned and sketched. The telescope is 14 years behind schedule and 20 times over budget. “We’ve worked as hard as we could to catch all of our mistakes and test and rehearse,” said John Mather, the Nobel Prize-winning astrophysicist who has been chief scientist of the NASA-led project for 25 years. Now, he said, “we’re going to put our zillion-dollar telescope on top of a stack of explosive material” and turn things over to fate.目前，这台望远镜已经折叠起来，准备放在阿丽亚娜5号火箭的顶部，令人难以置信的是，它已经建成。该火箭计划于12月22日从法属圭亚那库鲁升空，30多年前，其有效载荷詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜（JWST）首次设想并绘制草图。这台望远镜比计划落后14年，超过预算20倍。诺贝尔奖获得者、天体物理学家约翰·马瑟（JohnMather）表示：“我们尽最大努力捕捉所有错误，并进行测试和排练。”他是美国宇航局领导的项目的首席科学家，已有25年。现在，他说，“我们要把我们价值数百万美元的望远镜放在一堆爆炸性材料上”，然后把事情交给命运。

The story of JWST’s development over the past three decades has paralleled the tremendous progress we’ve made in our understanding of the cosmos, not least because of Webb’s predecessors. With the Hubble Space Telescope, we’ve learned that stars, galaxies and supermassive black holes existed far earlier in cosmic history than anyone expected, and that they have since undergone radical change. We’ve learned that dark matter and dark energy sculpt the cosmos. With the Kepler telescope and others, we’ve seen that all manner of planets decorate galaxies like baubles on Christmas trees, including billions of potentially habitable worlds in our Milky Way alone. These discoveries have raised questions that the James Webb Space Telescope can address. Astronomers also hope that, as with other telescopes, its sightings will raise new questions. “Every time we build new equipment,” Mather said, “we get a surprise.”&nbsp;JWST在过去三十年中的发展历程与我们在理解宇宙方面取得的巨大进步不谋而合，尤其是因为Webb的前辈。通过哈勃太空望远镜，我们了解到恒星、星系和超大质量黑洞在宇宙历史上的存在比任何人想象的都要早得多，并且从那以后它们经历了根本性的变化。我们已经了解到暗物质和暗能量塑造了宇宙。通过开普勒望远镜和其他望远镜，我们已经看到，所有种类的行星都像圣诞树上的装饰品一样装饰着星系，包括仅在我们银河系中就有数十亿个潜在的宜居星球。这些发现提出了詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜可以解决的问题。天文学家还希望，与其他望远镜一样，它的观测将引发新的问题。“每次我们制造新设备，”马瑟说，“我们都会得到一个惊喜。”&nbsp;

The launch will begin what the astronomer Natalie Batalha called “six months of pins and needles,” as the staggeringly complex telescope will attempt to unfold and focus itself in hundreds of steps. The observatory will spend a month floating 1 million miles to Lagrange point 2. On the way, it will transform into a celestial water lily, positioning its giant blossom of gold-plated mirror segments atop an even bigger silver leaf.天文学家娜塔莉·巴塔利亚（NatalieBatalha）称之为“六个月的针尖与针”，这台复杂得惊人的望远镜将试图以数百步的速度展开和聚焦。天文台将花一个月的时间将100万英里漂浮到拉格朗日点2。一路上，它将变成一朵天上的睡莲，把它巨大的镀金镜片放在一片更大的银叶上。

“It will be our own ‘dare mighty things’ moment,” said Grant Tremblay, an astrophysicist at Harvard University who served on the telescope’s time allocation committee. “It’s going to do amazing things. We’ll be in *The New York Times* talking about how this is witnessing the birth of stars at the edge of time, this is one of the earliest galaxies, this is the story of other Earths.”&nbsp;哈佛大学天体物理学家格兰特·特雷姆布雷（GrantTremblay）曾担任该望远镜的时间分配委员会成员，他说：“这将是我们自己的‘勇敢挑战’时刻。”。“它将做出惊人的事情。我们将在《纽约时报》上谈论这是如何见证恒星在时间边缘诞生的，这是最早的星系之一，这是其他地球的故事。”&nbsp;

“Please work,” Tremblay added, his eyes fluttering upward.“请工作吧，”特雷姆布雷补充道，他的眼睛向上眨着。

## **From Smooth to Lumpy&nbsp;**

The last time NASA launched an observatory of such significance — the Hubble Space Telescope, in 1990 — it was a disaster. “Absolutely catastrophic,” the veteran astronomer [Sandra Faber](https://www.ucolick.org/~faber/ ) told me. Faber was on the team that camped out at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, to diagnose the disorder. From the way a star in one of Hubble’s photos looked like a ring, she and a colleague inferred that the primary mirror — the big, concave one that bounced light to a secondary mirror that then reflected it onto a camera lens — had not been ground down to quite the right concavity to focus the light; it was half a wavelength too thick around the edge. If the primary and secondary mirrors had been tested together before launch, this aberration would have been noticed, but in the rush to get the long-delayed and over-budget telescope aloft, that testing never happened.上一次NASA发射如此重要的天文台——哈勃太空望远镜是在1990年，那是一场灾难。“绝对是灾难性的，”资深天文学家桑德拉·费伯告诉我。费伯是在马里兰州格林贝尔特NASA戈达德航天飞行中心露营诊断该疾病的团队成员。从哈勃的一张照片中的一颗恒星看起来像一个圆环的样子，她和一位同事推断，主镜——一个大的凹面镜，将光线反射到一个次镜，然后反射到一个相机镜头上——并没有被磨成完全合适的凹面来聚焦光线；边缘处有半个波长太厚。如果主镜和次镜在发射前一起测试过，这种畸变就会被注意到，但在急于将这台拖延已久、预算过高的望远镜升空的过程中，这种测试从未发生过。

Some NASA leaders called for abandoning the telescope, which was already a controversial project. Instead, Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland secured the funds for a rescue mission. Fixing it was possible because, as an optical telescope that’s sensitive to the colors of the rainbow rather than to infrared light, Hubble can get a clear view from low-Earth orbit, only 340 miles up, instead of having to travel a million miles away. In 1993, the space shuttle docked with Hubble, and astronauts installed a sort of contact lens. The telescope would go on to revolutionize astronomy and cosmology.一些美国宇航局领导人呼吁放弃望远镜，这已经是一个有争议的项目。相反，马里兰州参议员芭芭拉·米库尔斯基获得了救援任务的资金。修复它是可能的，因为哈勃作为一种对彩虹颜色敏感而不是对红外光敏感的光学望远镜，可以从低地球轨道（仅340英里）上获得清晰的视野，而不必旅行100万英里。1993年，航天飞机与哈勃对接，宇航员安装了一种隐形眼镜。这台望远镜将继续彻底改变天文学和宇宙学。

Perhaps the most important question about the universe for much of the 20th century was whether it had a beginning or if it has always been this way. For the British cosmologist Fred Hoyle and other believers in the latter “steady state” theory, “the compelling logic was simplicity,” said Jay Gallagher, an astronomer and professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. “That at one point something changed and the universe created matter, why did that have to be?” Hoyle, the steady-state proponent, attributed his rivals’ belief in the “Big Bang” (as he dubbed it) to the influence of the Book of Genesis. 也许在20世纪的大部分时间里，关于宇宙最重要的问题是它是否有一个开端，或者它是否一直是这样。对于英国宇宙学家弗雷德·霍伊尔（FredHoyle）和后一种“稳态”理论的其他信徒来说，“令人信服的逻辑很简单”，麦迪逊威斯康星大学（University of Wisconsin，Madison）天文学家兼名誉教授杰伊·加拉赫（JayGallagher）说。“在某一点上，某些东西发生了变化，宇宙创造了物质，为什么会这样？”稳态支持者霍伊尔将竞争对手对“大爆炸”（他称之为“大爆炸”）的信仰归因于《创世纪》的影响。

Then came a hiss in a radio antenna at Bell Labs in New Jersey in 1964. The hiss was generated by microwaves arriving from everywhere in the sky, exactly as predicted by the Big Bang theory. (The light was released in an early phase transition as the hot, dense universe cooled.) The discovery of the cosmic microwave background, as it was called, did not immediately end the debate — steady-state folks like Hoyle distrusted its interpretation and clung to their theory for many more decades. But for others, who recognized the afterglow of the Big Bang when they saw it, the CMB created a puzzle. The near-perfect uniformity of microwaves coming from all parts of the sky indicated that the newborn universe was astonishingly smooth — a purée of matter. “The puzzle is we see a very lumpy universe today,” said Faber, who was a graduate student studying galaxies in the late ’60s. “So the first challenge in understanding galaxies is to understand how the universe goes from smooth to lumpy.”1964年，新泽西贝尔实验室的无线电天线发出嘶嘶声。嘶嘶声是由来自天空任何地方的微波产生的，正如大爆炸理论所预测的那样。（当炽热致密的宇宙冷却时，光在早期相变中释放。）被称为宇宙微波背景的发现并没有立即结束这场争论——霍伊尔这样的稳态人士不相信它的解释，几十年来一直坚持他们的理论。但对于其他看到大爆炸余辉的人来说，CMB制造了一个谜团。来自天空各个部分的微波近乎完美的均匀性表明，新生的宇宙是惊人的光滑——一个物质的集合体。费伯是60年代末研究星系的研究生，他说：“我们今天看到的是一个非常块状的宇宙。”。“因此，理解星系的第一个挑战是理解宇宙是如何从光滑变为块状的。”

Cosmologists knew atoms must have gradually clumped together because of gravity, eventually fracturing into structures like stars and galaxies. But on paper, it seemed that the growth of structure would have been extraordinarily slow. Not only was matter initially smoothly distributed, and thus pulled in no particular direction by gravity, but the expansion of space and the pressure created by light itself would both have worked to separate matter, counteracting its weak gravitational attraction.&nbsp;宇宙学家知道，原子一定是在重力作用下逐渐聚集在一起，最终分裂成恒星和星系等结构。但从纸面上看，结构的增长似乎会非常缓慢。不仅物质最初是均匀分布的，因此重力不会将其拉向特定的方向，而且空间的膨胀和光本身产生的压力都会使物质分离，抵消其微弱的引力。&nbsp;

Enter dark matter. In the 1970s, Vera Rubin of the Carnegie Institute of Washington observed that the outskirts of galaxies rotate much faster than expected, as if whipped around by some extra, invisible source of gravity. This evidence for substantial missing matter in and around galaxies, dubbed dark matter, matched Fritz Zwicky’s 1930s observations that galaxies seem to attract each other more than they should based on their luminous matter alone. Also in the ’70s, Jim Peebles and Jerry Ostriker of Princeton University [calculated](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1973ApJ...186..467O/abstract ) that rotating galactic disks consisting only of stars, gas and dust should become unstable and swell into spheres; they posited that invisible matter must be creating a stronger gravitational well within which the visible disk rotates. In 1979, Faber and Gallagher wrote [an influential paper](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.aa.17.090179.001031 ) compiling all the evidence for dark matter, which they pegged at about 90% of the matter in the universe. (The current estimate is about 85%.)&nbsp;进入暗物质。20世纪70年代，华盛顿卡内基研究所的维拉·鲁宾（VeraRubin）观察到，星系外围的旋转速度比预期的要快得多，似乎受到了某种额外的、看不见的引力源的影响。这一星系内部和周围大量缺失物质的证据，即所谓的暗物质，与弗里茨·兹威基（Fritz Zwicky）上世纪30年代的观察结果相吻合，即星系之间的相互吸引程度似乎超过了仅基于发光物质的相互吸引程度。同样在70年代，普林斯顿大学的吉姆·皮布尔斯和杰里·奥斯特里克计算出，仅由恒星、气体和尘埃组成的旋转星系盘应该变得不稳定，膨胀成球体；他们推测，不可见物质一定在创造一个更强的引力阱，可见圆盘在这个引力阱中旋转。1979年，费伯和加拉赫撰写了一篇有影响力的论文，汇集了暗物质的所有证据，他们认为暗物质约占宇宙物质的90%。（目前估计约为85%。）&nbsp;

These researchers realized that dark matter, with its substantial gravity and imperviousness to light’s pressure, could have bunched up relatively quickly in the early universe. Peebles, who won half of the [2019 Nobel Prize in Physics](https://www.quantamagazine.org/nobel-prize-in-physics-to-james-peebles-michel-mayor-and-didier-queloz-20191008/ ) for his contributions to cosmology, developed a qualitative picture in which dark matter particles would have glommed together into clumps (known as halos) that then combined into bigger and bigger clumps. The British astrophysicist Simon White demonstrated this “hierarchical clustering” process in primitive 1980s computer simulations. Though visible matter was at that time too complicated to simulate, researchers surmised that the conglomerating dark matter would have brought luminous matter along for the ride: Corralled within dark matter halos, atoms would have bumped together, heated up, sunk toward the center and eventually gravitationally collapsed into stars and disk-shaped galaxies.这些研究人员意识到，暗物质由于其巨大的引力和对光的压力的不渗透性，可能在早期宇宙中聚集得相对较快。由于对宇宙学的贡献，皮布尔斯获得了2019年诺贝尔物理学奖的一半奖金。在皮布尔斯的研究中，暗物质粒子会聚集成团（称为光晕），然后再结合成越来越大的团。英国天体物理学家西蒙·怀特（SimonWhite）在20世纪80年代的原始计算机模拟中演示了这种“层次聚类”过程。尽管当时可见物质太复杂，无法进行模拟，但研究人员推测，聚集的暗物质会带来发光物质：在暗物质晕中，原子会碰撞在一起，加热，向中心下沉，最终在引力作用下坍缩成恒星和盘状星系。

Although most cosmologists became convinced of this picture, a big question was how variations in the density of matter initially set in, jump-starting the gravitational clustering process. “People had no clear idea about what were reasonable initial conditions about the formation of cosmic structure,” White, who is now retired and living in Germany, told me over Zoom. “You could run these simulations, but you didn’t have any idea what you should put in at the beginning.”&nbsp;尽管大多数宇宙学家都相信这一点，但一个大问题是，物质密度的变化最初是如何开始的，从而启动了引力聚集过程。“人们不清楚宇宙结构形成的合理初始条件是什么，”现已退休并生活在德国的怀特告诉我。“您可以运行这些模拟，但一开始您不知道应该输入什么。”&nbsp;

“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” the cosmologist Alan Guth scrawled in his notebook in 1979. He had calculated that if space suddenly blew up like the surface of a balloon at the start of the Big Bang, this would explain how it got so huge, smooth and flat. [Cosmic inflation](https://www.quantamagazine.org/videos/where-did-the-universe-come-from/ ), as Guth dubbed the primordial growth spurt, quickly became popular as a Big Bang add-on. Cosmologists soon [noted](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983veu..conf.....G/abstract ) that, during inflation, quantum fluctuations in the fabric of space would have gotten frozen in as space blew up, producing subtle density variations throughout the universe. The putative dense spots created by inflation could have served as the seeds of future structures.&nbsp;1979年，宇宙学家艾伦·古思（AlanGuth）在笔记本上潦草写道：“惊人的实现”。他曾计算过，如果宇宙在大爆炸开始时突然像气球的表面一样爆炸，这就可以解释它是如何变得如此巨大、平滑和平坦的。宇宙膨胀，古思称之为原始增长突飞猛进，很快作为一个大爆炸的附加组件流行起来。宇宙学家很快注意到，在膨胀期间，空间结构中的量子涨落会随着空间爆炸而冻结，从而在整个宇宙中产生细微的密度变化。通货膨胀造成的假定密集点本可以成为未来结构的种子。&nbsp;

![A notebook page with a box around the words “SPECTACULAR&nbsp; REALIZATION” written in all caps at the top.](https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2021/12/Spectacular-Realization_1979_crop.jpg )

In 1979, Alan Guth realized that a burst of exponential expansion at the start of the Big Bang would explain several puzzling properties of the universe.&nbsp;&nbsp;1979年，艾伦·古思（AlanGuth）意识到，大爆炸开始时的指数膨胀可以解释宇宙的一些令人费解的性质。&nbsp;&nbsp;

These tiny density variations were indeed measured in the CMB in the early 1990s — the feat that earned John Mather, the Webb telescope’s top scientist, his Nobel. But even before they were measured, people like Faber were working the dense spots into the plot. In 1984, she and three co-authors published [a paper in Nature](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1984Natur.311..517B/abstract ) that strung everything together. “It’s the first soup-to-nuts description of how inflation can make fluctuations and what the fluctuations would do later to make galaxies,” she said.这些微小的密度变化确实是在20世纪90年代初在CMB中测量到的，这一壮举使韦伯望远镜的首席科学家约翰·马瑟获得了诺贝尔奖。但是，甚至在测量之前，像费伯这样的人就在把密集的点放进情节中。1984年，她和三位合著者在《自然》杂志上发表了一篇论文，将一切联系在一起。她说：“这是第一次对膨胀如何产生涨落以及涨落在以后如何产生星系的描述。”。

But the story was speculative from start to finish. And even if it was broadly true, key dates and details were unknown.&nbsp;但这个故事从头到尾都是推测性的。即使这基本上是真的，关键日期和细节也不得而知。&nbsp;

One of the Hubble telescope’s most impactful discoveries, and a major impetus for building its successor, the Webb, occurred in 1995, two years after its corrective lens was installed. Bob Williams, then the director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, the operations center for Hubble as it will be for Webb, decided at the suggestion of some postdocs to devote all 100 hours of his “director’s discretionary time,” with which he could point Hubble wherever he wanted, to pointing it at nothing — a dark, featureless little patch of sky narrower than a thumbnail moon. The idea was to look for any incredibly faint, distant objects that might have been hiding beyond the reach of less sensitive telescopes.&nbsp;哈勃望远镜最具影响力的发现之一，也是建造其继任者韦伯望远镜的主要动力，发生在1995年，也就是安装校正透镜两年后。时任巴尔的摩太空望远镜科学研究所所长的鲍勃·威廉姆斯（BobWilliams）在一些博士后的建议下，决定将其“所长的自由支配时间”的100个小时全部用于哈勃望远镜的指向任何他想指向的地方，而不是指向任何东西——黑暗，毫无特色的一小块天空，比一轮微缩的月亮还窄。这个想法是为了寻找任何可能隐藏在灵敏度较低的望远镜够不到的极其微弱、遥远的物体。&nbsp;

Colleagues thought this was a waste. The late John Bahcall tried to talk Williams out of it. Bahcall and his wife, Neta Bahcall, well-known astrophysicists, were typical in thinking that structures like stars and galaxies arose relatively late in cosmic history. If so, then trying to resolve faint, faraway, long-ago objects wouldn’t work, because none would exist. The Bahcalls and many other theorists thought Williams’ photo would come out dark.同事们认为这是浪费。已故的约翰·巴克尔试图劝说威廉姆斯不要这样做。巴赫考尔和他的妻子内塔·巴赫考尔是著名的天体物理学家，他们典型地认为恒星和星系等结构在宇宙历史中出现的相对较晚。如果是这样的话，那么试图解析微弱的、遥远的、很久以前的对象是行不通的，因为根本不存在任何对象。Bahcalls和许多其他理论家认为Williams的照片会变暗。

But during the 100-hour exposure, the lid of a treasure chest opened: The small rectangle of space glittered with thousands of galaxies of all shapes, sizes and hues. Astronomers were stunned.但在100小时的曝光过程中，一个宝箱的盖子打开了：这个小小的长方形空间闪烁着数千个不同形状、大小和颜色的星系。天文学家们震惊了。

Taken over 10 days in December 1995, the Hubble Deep Field photo revealed about 3,000 galaxies within a patch of sky about one-twelfth the width of the moon.1995年12月拍摄了10多天的哈勃深场照片，照片显示在一片约为月球宽度十二分之一的天空中约有3000个星系。

Farther-away galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field photo appear redder, since their light has traveled longer through expanding space to get here and therefore has been stretched, or “redshifted,” to longer wavelengths. Through this color-coding, the Deep Field image provides a 3D view of the cosmos and a timeline of galaxy evolution. Galaxies appear at all ages and stages of development — proof that the universe has changed radically over time. “Gone out of the window, never to be heard from again, was the steady-state theory,” said Faber. “That was a great intellectual breakthrough, that you could take one picture with a telescope, you could look back in time, and you could see that the universe was a different beast back then.”&nbsp;在哈勃深场照片中，距离较远的星系看起来更红，因为它们的光在膨胀的空间中传播的时间较长，因此被拉伸或“红移”到更长的波长。通过这种颜色编码，深场图像提供了宇宙的3D视图和星系演化的时间线。星系出现在所有年龄和发展阶段，这证明宇宙随时间发生了根本性的变化。“走出窗户，再也听不到声音，这是稳态理论，”费伯说。“这是一个巨大的智力突破，你可以用望远镜拍一张照片，你可以回首过去，你可以看到宇宙在当时是另一种野兽。”&nbsp;

The photo showed that bright objects formed in the universe far more quickly than most experts expected. This bolstered the theory that they didn’t form on the strength of their gravity alone, but were carried on the backs of merging dark matter halos.&nbsp;这张照片显示，明亮物体在宇宙中形成的速度远远快于大多数专家的预期。这支持了这样一种理论，即它们并非仅仅是在引力的作用下形成的，而是在合并的暗物质晕的背景下形成的。&nbsp;

Galaxies in early times were strange-looking — small and disheveled, like ugly ducklings that would take billions of years to grow into swans. “The beautiful universe with the beautiful [spiral and elliptical galaxies] of today is really kind of a late development,” Faber said, “and that too was visible in the picture.” Some of the duckling galaxies were colliding and merging, supporting the hierarchical clustering theory of cosmic structure growth. And clumps of stars in the long-ago galaxies were surprisingly bright, indicating that the stars were far more massive and luminous than modern, sun-type stars.&nbsp;早期的星系看起来很奇怪——小而蓬乱，就像丑小鸭，需要数十亿年才能长成天鹅。费伯说：“今天有着美丽的（螺旋星系和椭圆星系）的美丽宇宙实际上是一种较晚的发展，这在照片中也是可见的。”一些小鸭星系正在碰撞和合并，支持宇宙结构增长的层次聚类理论。很久以前星系中的星团异常明亮，这表明这些恒星的质量和亮度远远高于现代太阳型恒星。&nbsp;

Astronomers observed that most galaxies reached peak luminosity, forming stars most quickly, around “redshift 2” — the distance from which light has stretched to twice its emitted wavelength by the time it gets here, corresponding to about 2 billion years after the Big Bang. After that, for reasons now thought to relate to the mysterious supermassive black holes growing at galaxies’ centers, many galaxies dimmed.&nbsp;天文学家观察到，大多数星系的光度达到峰值，在“红移2”附近形成恒星的速度最快，红移2指的是光到达此处时，从该距离延伸到其发射波长的两倍，相当于大爆炸后约20亿年。此后，由于现在被认为与星系中心生长的神秘超大质量黑洞有关的原因，许多星系变暗。&nbsp;

The most striking thing about the timeline of galaxy evolution visible in the Deep Field photo, though, was that there’s no beginning in sight. As far as Hubble’s glass eye could see, there were galaxies. In even deeper-field photos taken with upgraded cameras that astronauts installed on the telescope later, smudges of light have been tentatively spotted as far off as redshift 10, which corresponds to around 500 million years after the Big Bang. It’s now thought likely that structures started forming hundreds of millions of years before that.然而，在这张深场照片中，星系演化的时间线最引人注目的是，我们看不到任何开始。在哈勃的玻璃眼所能看到的范围内，有许多星系。在宇航员后来安装在望远镜上的升级相机拍摄的更深入的实地照片中，已经初步发现了远至红移10的光晕，这相当于宇宙大爆炸后约5亿年的光晕。现在人们认为，这些构造很可能是在那之前的数亿年开始形成的。

But galaxies in the process of forming, their matter somehow fragmenting into stars for the first time, are both too far and too faint for Hubble to detect, and too redshifted: The light from these galaxies has stretched straight out of the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum and into the infrared. To see them, we need a bigger, infrared-sensing telescope.但星系在形成过程中，其物质以某种方式首次碎裂成恒星，距离太远、太暗，哈勃无法探测到，而且红移太大：这些星系发出的光直接从电磁光谱的可见部分延伸到红外。要看到它们，我们需要一个更大的红外感应望远镜。

“What Hubble succeeded in doing with the Hubble Deep Field is finding that there were galaxies at redshifts much higher than we thought,” Neta Bahcall told me. “A question for James Webb is when did it start, and how did it start so early.”内塔·巴赫告诉我：“哈勃成功地利用哈勃深场发现，有一些星系的红移比我们想象的要高得多。”。“詹姆斯·韦伯的一个问题是，它是什么时候开始的，又是怎么开始得这么早的。”

## **Planets Out the Wazoo**

In October 1995, two months before Hubble stared at nothing and glimpsed the history of time, the Swiss astronomer Michel Mayor announced another major discovery at a conference in Florence, Italy: He and his graduate student, Didier Queloz, had spotted a planet orbiting another star.1995年10月，就在哈勃望远镜什么都看不见、瞥见时间历史的两个月前，瑞士天文学家米歇尔·马约尔在意大利佛罗伦萨的一次会议上宣布了另一项重大发现：他和他的研究生迪迪埃·奎洛兹发现了一颗围绕另一颗恒星运行的行星。

In the back of the auditorium at Mayor’s talk, Natalie Batalha, then a graduate student from California, failed to register the importance of what she had just heard. “It’s funny how these things happen, because in retrospect it was a pivotal moment,” Batalha said recently, framed by three planets orbiting a star in her virtual background. “It was the dawn of this new era of exoplanet exploration, but was also a transformational moment in my life, and I didn’t know it yet.”在市长演讲的礼堂后面，当时来自加州的研究生娜塔莉·巴塔利亚没有意识到她刚才听到的内容的重要性。“这些事情发生的方式很有趣，因为回顾过去，这是一个关键时刻，”巴塔利亚最近说，她的虚拟背景是围绕一颗恒星运行的三颗行星。“这是探索系外行星新时代的黎明，但也是我生命中的一个转折时刻，我还不知道。”

At the time, exoplanet searching was a scientific backwater, and Mayor and Queloz’s method [had seemed like a long shot](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/2/799 ). Using a spectrograph, which splits starlight into its color components, they monitored more than 100 sunlike stars hoping to detect a Doppler shift, where an object looks bluer or redder when it’s approaching or receding, respectively. This could indicate that the star is wobbling because it is disturbed by the gravity of an orbiting planet. The technique seemed far-fetched because a planet would have to be ludicrously heavy and close to its host star to set the star wobbling enough to be seen with the best available spectrographs. Yet when Mayor and Queloz looked at 51 Pegasi, a sunlike star 50 light-years away, the wobble was huge: Eliminating other possibilities, they determined that a Jupiter-size planet whips around the star once every 4.2 days, eight times closer in than Mercury’s distance from our sun.当时，探索系外行星是一个科学上的死水，马约尔和奎洛兹的方法似乎遥遥无期。他们利用光谱仪将星光分解成不同的颜色成分，监测了100多颗类太阳恒星，希望检测到多普勒频移，即物体在接近或后退时分别看起来更蓝或更红。这可能表明这颗恒星正在抖动，因为它受到绕轨道行星引力的干扰。这项技术似乎有些牵强附会，因为一颗行星必须非常重，而且离它的主星很近，才能使恒星摆动到可以用最好的光谱仪看到的程度。然而，当Mayor和Queloz观察距离我们50光年远的51颗类太阳恒星Pegasi时，摆动是巨大的：排除了其他可能性，他们确定一颗木星大小的行星每4.2天围绕该恒星旋转一次，距离我们太阳的距离是水星的八倍。

Not only had Mayor and Queloz bagged an exoplanet (and, eventually, the other half of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics, shared with Peebles), the planet itself, 51 Pegasi b, single-handedly upended the textbook understanding of what solar systems are like. As the planetary scientist Heidi Hammel put it, “We had been taught a lovely fairy tale about how our solar system formed,” one designed to explain why rocky planets lie close to a star while giant gas and ice planets form far away. So what was 51 Pegasi b, a “hot Jupiter,” doing practically grazing its sun?&nbsp;马约尔和奎洛兹不仅获得了一颗系外行星（并最终获得了2019年诺贝尔物理学奖的另一半，与皮布尔斯分享），这颗行星本身，即51颗佩加西b星，一手颠覆了教科书中对太阳系的理解。正如行星科学家海蒂·哈默尔（HeidiHammel）所说，“我们被教导了一个关于我们太阳系如何形成的可爱童话”，这个童话旨在解释为什么岩石行星离恒星很近，而巨大的气体和冰行星却离恒星很远。那么，“炽热的木星”Pegasi b实际上是在掠太阳吗？&nbsp;

Batalha remembers the audience’s reaction in Florence to Mayor’s presentation — silence. Soon enough, though, skepticism gave way to more hot-Jupiter discoveries. And as telescopes and techniques improved, other exoplanets showed up as well. Sixteen years after that day in Florence, Batalha would lead the NASA team that discovered the first confirmed rocky exoplanet, Kepler 10b.巴塔利亚还记得佛罗伦萨的观众对市长演讲的反应——沉默。然而，很快，怀疑论就让位给了更热的木星发现。随着望远镜和技术的改进，其他系外行星也出现了。16年后的今天，在佛罗伦萨，巴塔利亚将领导美国宇航局的团队，发现了第一颗经证实的岩石系外行星开普勒10b。

Growing up in California’s East Bay, Batalha (then Natalie Stout) hardly thought about science, though she was thrilled, at age 17, by Sally Ride’s trip to space in 1983. Though neither of her parents went to college, she was accepted at the University of California, Berkeley, entering as a business major. But then, while she was doing laundry one weekend sophomore year, she remembers suddenly saying to herself: “‘Forget talent, resources. If I could do anything in the world, what would it be?’ And surprisingly the answer came to me immediately, and it was to work for the space program.”巴塔利亚（当时的娜塔莉·斯托特）在加利福尼亚州的东湾长大，几乎没有想过科学，尽管她在17岁时对1983年萨利·里德的太空之旅感到兴奋。虽然她的父母都没有上过大学，但她被加州大学伯克利分校录取，成为了一名商业专业的学生。但是，大二的一个周末，当她在洗衣服的时候，她记得自己突然对自己说：“忘记天赋和资源吧。如果我能在世界上做任何事，那会是什么？”令人惊讶的是，我立刻想到了答案，那就是为太空计划工作。”

She enrolled in a physics class. She struggled, but loved it. That everyday happenings could be explained with mathematical equations “gave meaning to my life,” Batalha said. “It made me see my place in the universe differently. I thought that if you could write an equation to explain the interference off of thin films” — the reason oily puddles create rainbow shimmers — “what limit is there to what we can know about the natural world?”&nbsp;她报名上了物理课。她挣扎着，但很喜欢。巴塔利亚说，每天发生的事情都可以用数学方程式来解释，“给我的生活带来了意义”。“这让我对自己在宇宙中的位置有了不同的看法。我想，如果你能写出一个方程式来解释薄膜的干涉”——油性水坑产生彩虹微光的原因——“我们对自然界的了解有什么限制？”&nbsp;

Batalha thought she’d combine science with business somehow. She continued taking classes, then landed a summer internship at the Wyoming Infrared Observatory, one of the few ground-based infrared telescopes. When she got there, she told her adviser and cohort that she wasn’t like them, that she wasn’t planning on being a scientist. But when her adviser gave her a problem to work on and she solved it, which later led to a publication, he told her “not to sell myself short,” she said, and to knock on Gibor Basri’s door when she got back to Berkeley.巴塔利亚认为她会以某种方式将科学与商业结合起来。她继续上课，然后在怀俄明州红外天文台（Wyoming Infrared Observatory）暑期实习，这是为数不多的地面红外望远镜之一。当她到达那里时，她告诉她的顾问和同伴，她不喜欢他们，她不打算成为一名科学家。但当她的顾问给了她一个问题让她去解决，她解决了这个问题，后来出版了一本书，他告诉她“不要低估自己”，她说，当她回到伯克利时，他要敲吉伯·巴斯里的门。

Basri, a stellar astronomer, put her to work analyzing star spectra. Experiencing the scientific method firsthand hooked her. She also fell in love with her office mate, Basri’s postdoc, Celso Batalha. She married him, went to graduate school in astronomy at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and had a son, Nolan, and daughter, Natasha, in quick succession. Two more kids would follow. Over those years, she and Celso Batalha, who is Brazilian, moved the family back and forth between California and Rio de Janeiro. Life in Rio was beautiful but complicated; she remembers driving past some slums and seeing a charred corpse on the side of the road. They eventually settled in the Bay Area.&nbsp;巴斯里，一位恒星天文学家，让她从事分析恒星光谱的工作。亲身体验科学方法使她着迷。她还爱上了她的办公室伙伴，巴斯里的博士后塞尔索·巴塔利亚。她嫁给了他，在加州大学圣克鲁斯分校攻读天文学研究生，并相继生下儿子诺兰和女儿娜塔莎。接下来还会有两个孩子。这些年来，她和巴西籍塞尔索·巴塔利亚（CelsoBatalha）一家在加利福尼亚州和里约热内卢之间来回搬家。里约热内卢的生活是美丽而复杂的；她记得开车经过一些贫民窟，看到路边有一具烧焦的尸体。他们最终在海湾地区定居下来。&nbsp;

Considering herself primarily a mother who did astronomy on the side, Batalha never attended conferences. But when she was invited to present new data on star spots at a stellar spectroscopy meeting in Vienna in the fall of 1995, she made an exception, taking her parents along to Europe to babysit her youngest child. She decided to stay for another conference on planets that was taking place in Florence the following week. It was on the last day of the second conference that Batalha noticed a TV camera setting up for a talk that had been added to the schedule at the last minute. “Then Michel Mayor gets up and just so nonchalantly talks about this planet discovery,” she said.&nbsp;巴塔利亚认为自己主要是一位兼职做天文学的母亲，她从未参加过会议。但1995年秋天，当她应邀在维也纳的一次恒星光谱学会议上介绍有关星点的新数据时，她破例带着父母去欧洲照顾最小的孩子。她决定留下来参加下周在佛罗伦萨举行的另一次行星会议。就在第二次会议的最后一天，巴塔利亚注意到一台电视摄像机正在为一场演讲做准备，而这场演讲在最后一分钟被加入了日程。“然后米歇尔·马约尔站了起来，漫不经心地谈论这颗行星的发现，”她说。&nbsp;

At first, Batalha thought little about the newfound hot Jupiter and kept studying star spots in Santa Cruz. Then a year or so later, she heard about a scientist at NASA’s Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley named Bill Borucki who was determined to build a space telescope capable of detecting rocky, Earth-size exoplanets, not just gas giants. Borucki planned to use the transit method: Instead of tracking changes in the color of starlight as Mayor and Queloz had done, he would look for periodic dips in the starlight’s intensity caused by an orbiting planet crossing in front of the star, blocking a small bit of its light.起初，巴塔利亚很少考虑新发现的炽热木星，一直在研究圣克鲁斯的星点。大约一年后，她听说美国宇航局位于硅谷的艾姆斯研究中心有一位名叫比尔·博鲁基的科学家，他决心建造一台能够探测岩石状、地球大小的系外行星的太空望远镜，而不仅仅是气态巨行星。Borucki计划使用凌日法：他不会像Mayor和Queloz那样跟踪星光颜色的变化，而是会寻找一颗绕轨道运行的行星在恒星前方交叉，阻挡了一小段星光而导致的星光强度周期性下降。

Batalha didn’t think this would work. Star spots, as she happened to know, are about the same size as Earth. So she thought a small transiting planet would be indistinguishable from a star spot sweeping around on a rotating star. She wrote to Borucki about the problem. He wrote back and said NASA had rejected his proposal in part for that very reason, and would she come work with him at Ames to figure out how to tell star spots apart from rocky worlds?&nbsp;巴塔利亚认为这行不通。她碰巧知道，星点的大小与地球差不多。因此，她认为一颗小的凌日行星与围绕旋转恒星旋转的星点是无法区分的。她就这个问题写信给博鲁基。他回信说，美国宇航局拒绝了他的提议，部分原因就在于此，她是否会在艾姆斯与他合作，找出如何区分星点和岩石世界？&nbsp;

She would, and they did. Next time, NASA greenlit Borucki’s proposal, and Batalha became a project scientist. The Kepler Space Telescope — designed by Borucki and his team to continually monitor the brightness of approximately 150,000 stars in search of the dips of transiting planets — lifted off in March 2009. The Batalhas took all four kids to Cape Canaveral, Florida, for the launch.她会的，他们做到了。下一次，NASA批准了博鲁基的提议，巴塔利亚成为了项目科学家。开普勒太空望远镜于2009年3月升空。开普勒太空望远镜由博鲁基和他的团队设计，用于持续监测约150000颗恒星的亮度，以寻找凌日行星的倾角。Batalhas带着四个孩子去了佛罗里达州的卡纳维拉尔角进行发射。

Kepler delivered on Earth-size planets. “Kepler 10b was identified in the first 10 days of data we got back from the spacecraft,” Batalha said. When they graphed the brightness of the host star over time, the dip was visible to the eye. Follow-up observations from the ground confirmed it was a genuine planet and one that, based on its mass and radius, had to be rocky. Batalha presented the unequivocal detection in January 2011, following a more tentative claim of a rocky exoplanet labeled CoRoT-7b by astronomers in Europe. Neither Kepler 10b nor CoRoT-7b earned the coveted designation “Earth-like,” because they orbited near their parent star rather than in the “habitable zone,” where water is liquid. (The first rocky, watery and potentially Earth-like planet, Kepler 186f, made headlines in 2014. Batalha wasn’t formally involved with the analysis.)开普勒在地球大小的行星上发射。巴塔利亚说：“开普勒10b是在我们从宇宙飞船返回的前10天的数据中确定的。”。当他们绘制出主星的亮度随时间的变化曲线时，肉眼可以看到亮度的下降。从地面进行的后续观测证实，这是一颗真正的行星，根据其质量和半径，它必须是岩石行星。巴塔利亚于2011年1月提出了明确的探测结果，此前欧洲天文学家更具试探性地声称有一颗被标记为CoRoT-7b的岩石系外行星。开普勒10b和科罗-7b都没有获得令人垂涎的“类地”称号，因为它们的轨道靠近母星，而不是在水为液态的“宜居区”。（开普勒186f是第一颗岩石状、水状且可能类似地球的行星，2014年成为头条新闻。巴塔利亚没有正式参与分析。）

The Kepler telescope, before being prematurely hobbled by the failure of two of its motors, discovered more than 2,600 exoplanets. More than 4,500 have been counted in all, a sufficient number for astronomers to study their statistical properties. Just as 51 Pegasi b had suggested, our solar system is atypical. For instance, the most common type of planet in the galaxy is a size we don’t have, in between rocky planets and giants. Planetary astronomers don’t yet understand the surplus of these so-called super-Earths or sub-Neptunes, or what these midsize planets are like, or how they form. New principles of planet formation and evolution are needed.开普勒望远镜在因两台发动机故障而过早蹒跚前行之前，发现了2600多颗系外行星。总共有4500多人被计算在内，这足以让天文学家研究他们的统计特性。正如51 Pegasi b所说，我们的太阳系是非典型的。例如，银河系中最常见的行星类型是我们没有的大小，介于岩石行星和巨行星之间。行星天文学家尚不了解这些所谓的超级地球或次海王星的剩余部分，也不了解这些中等大小的行星是什么样的，也不知道它们是如何形成的。需要新的行星形成和演化原理。

Extrapolating the data so far, researchers think that our galaxy holds billions of rocky, watery planets, suggesting that life, too, might be common. Until we find evidence of life actually inhabiting another planet, though, it remains possible that its emergence on Earth was a fluke, and that we are alone.&nbsp;根据迄今为止的数据推断，研究人员认为我们的银河系拥有数十亿颗岩石状、水状行星，这表明生命也可能很常见。然而，在我们找到生命确实存在于另一颗行星的证据之前，它在地球上的出现仍然可能是偶然的，而我们是孤独的。&nbsp;

Happily, the Webb telescope will be powerful enough to probe the atmospheres and climates of other Earths — or even, if we’re very lucky, find evidence of an actual alien biosphere.令人高兴的是，韦伯望远镜的威力将足以探测其他地球的大气层和气候，如果我们非常幸运的话，甚至可以找到外星生物圈的证据。

“Infrared is fantastic for exoplanets,” Batalha said.巴塔利亚说：“红外对于系外行星来说非常棒。”。

## **One Strike and You’re Out&nbsp;**

One morning in 1987, the astrophysicist Riccardo Giacconi, who was then the director of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) and of the yet-to-launch Hubble, asked deputy director Garth Illingworth to start thinking about Hubble’s successor. “My immediate reaction is, ‘Argh, we haven’t even got Hubble launched yet, and we’ve got a million things to do on there — it has major problems — so how can we do this as well?’” Illingworth recalled recently. “He said, ‘Trust me, you’ve got to start early because I know it takes ages to do this.’” Hubble had been under development since around 1970, spearheaded in its early years by the NASA astronomer Nancy Roman following decades of campaigning by Princeton’s Lyman Spitzer; they are known as the mother and father of Hubble.1987年的一个上午，当时担任太空望远镜科学研究所（STScI）和尚未发射哈勃望远镜的主任的天体物理学家里卡多·贾科尼请副主任加思·伊林沃斯开始考虑哈勃的继任者。“我的即时反应是，‘啊，我们甚至还没有发射哈勃，我们在那里有一百万件事要做——它有重大问题——那么我们如何才能做到这一点？’”Illingworth最近回忆道。“他说，‘相信我，你必须早点开始，因为我知道这样做需要很长时间。’”哈勃望远镜自1970年左右开始开发，早期由美国宇航局天文学家南希·罗曼带头，普林斯顿大学的莱曼·斯皮策（Lyman Spitzer）进行了数十年的竞选活动；他们被称为哈勃的母亲和父亲。

Illingworth, who is from Australia, got together with his STScI colleagues Pierre Bely of France and Peter Stockman of the U.S. to brainstorm about the next-generation space telescope. They had basically nothing to go on. “We started thinking about what would be good to go beyond Hubble and to complement whatever it did and explore new areas,” Illingworth said, “and the IR was one clear area.” Infrared light is prohibitively difficult to observe from the ground. The trio figured that in space, where the infrared background is more than 1 million times lower, there would be plenty to see. “When you put a powerful new capability out there, you open an immense number of scientific horizons.”&nbsp;来自澳大利亚的Illingworth与他的STScI同事法国的Pierre Bely和美国的Peter Stockman一起集思广益，讨论下一代太空望远镜。他们基本上没有什么事情可做。Illingworth说：“我们开始思考，除了哈勃望远镜之外，还有什么好的地方可以补充它所做的一切，并探索新的领域，IR是一个明确的领域。”红外光很难从地面观察到。三人认为，在红外背景低于100万倍的太空中，会有很多东西可以看到。“当你推出一种强大的新能力时，你就打开了大量的科学视野。”&nbsp;

For an IR telescope to be as sensitive as Hubble, which has a 2.4-meter-wide primary mirror, Illingworth, Bely and Stockman realized that it would need to be significantly bigger, since it detects bigger wavelengths. They considered that the mirror might have to fold to fit in a rocket. They also knew it had to be cold, otherwise its heat would saturate its own sensors. Rather than actively cool the telescope, they thought to exploit the extreme frigidity of outer space by blocking the heat of the Earth, moon and sun. Their vague conception of a large, passively cooled infrared telescope, greatly elaborated upon, would become the cargo now awaiting launch in Kourou.为了使红外望远镜像哈勃望远镜一样灵敏，它有一个2.4米宽的主镜，伊利沃思、贝里和斯托克曼意识到它需要大得多，因为它能探测到更大的波长。他们认为镜子可能需要折叠才能装进火箭。他们也知道它必须是冷的，否则它的热量会使它自己的传感器饱和。他们没有主动冷却望远镜，而是想通过阻挡地球、月球和太阳的热量来利用外层空间的极端寒冷。他们对大型被动冷却红外望远镜的模糊概念进行了详细阐述，现在将成为库鲁等待发射的货物。

Leading astronomers convened at STScI in 1989 to discuss the science that an infrared space telescope might be good for. Discussions slowed during Hubble’s disastrous start and salvation, then picked up again in the mid-’90s. In 1995, John Mather, a reedy, gentlemanly astrophysicist at the Goddard Space Flight Center, got a call from NASA headquarters asking if he’d like to join the project. Realizing that an infrared telescope “would do so much for so many people,” he dropped everything and signed on. He’s been JWST’s top scientist ever since.&nbsp;1989年，著名天文学家在STScI召开会议，讨论红外太空望远镜可能有助于发展的科学。在哈勃望远镜灾难性的诞生和拯救过程中，讨论的速度有所放缓，然后在90年代中期又有所回升。1995年，约翰·马瑟（JohnMather），戈达德航天飞行中心（Goddard Space Flight Center）一位绅士风度的天体物理学家，接到美国国家航空航天局（NASA）总部的电话，询问他是否愿意加入该项目。意识到红外望远镜“能为这么多人做这么多”，他放下一切，签约了。从那以后，他一直是JWST的顶尖科学家。&nbsp;

Mather calls himself a “theoretical instrument builder.” He started building telescopes as a kid in pastoral New Jersey, assembling parts from catalogs in the hope of getting a closer look at the surface of Mars. As a young man in the 1970s, Mather worked on a balloon-borne instrument that failed; he and his colleagues concluded that they hadn’t tested it enough before launch. “Murphy’s law had been proven one more time,” he wrote in an autobiographical account. But lessons learned led to the triumph of COBE, the NASA satellite experiment for which he and George Smoot would share the Nobel. In the early ’90s, COBE measured the subtle variations in the cosmic microwave background that are thought to have seeded all later cosmological structures. In Mather’s mind, theorizing about the cosmos is fine, but you need ingenious instruments to know anything for sure. “So let’s build the equipment,” he told me this fall. “To me that’s a heroic thing to do.”马瑟称自己为“理论仪器建设者”他小时候开始在新泽西州田园地区建造望远镜，从目录中组装部件，希望能更近距离地观察火星表面。20世纪70年代，马瑟还是个年轻人的时候，他研制了一种气球载仪器，但失败了；他和他的同事得出结论，他们在发射前没有对其进行足够的测试。“墨菲定律又被证明了一次，”他在自传中写道。但吸取的教训导致了COBE的成功，这是美国宇航局的卫星实验，他和乔治·斯穆特将分享诺贝尔奖。在90年代初，COBE测量了宇宙微波背景的细微变化，这些变化被认为是所有后来的宇宙结构的种子。在马瑟看来，对宇宙进行理论化是很好的，但你需要精巧的工具才能确定任何事情。今年秋天，他告诉我：“那么让我们来建造设备吧。”。“对我来说，这是一件英勇的事。”

Mather had contemplated wild designs, including telescopes that fold. In the difficult budgetary climate of 1996, however, a committee of top astronomers studying the infrared telescope concept proposed a 4-meter mirror, which would fit in a rocket fairing, dramatically cutting costs and complexity. Illingworth thought this was “stupid. It was not going to be as good as Hubble.” NASA’s leader at the time, Dan Goldin, evidently felt similarly. At the American Astronomical Society meeting that year, Goldin said in an address: “Why do you ask for such a modest thing? Why not go after 6 or 7 meters?” As committee member Wendy Freedman remembers it, “Goldin essentially said, ‘You guys are really a bunch of scaredy-cats.’” He got a standing ovation. “In my mind he saved the telescope,” said Illingworth. It would be bigger. It would also have to fold after all.马瑟曾设想过一些疯狂的设计，包括折叠望远镜。然而，在1996年预算紧张的情况下，一个由研究红外望远镜概念的顶级天文学家组成的委员会提出了一个4米的镜子，可以安装在火箭整流罩中，大大降低了成本和复杂性。伊林沃斯认为这是“愚蠢的。它不会像哈勃那样好。”美国宇航局当时的领导人丹·戈尔丁显然也有同样的感受。在那一年的美国天文学会会议上，戈尔丁在一次演讲中说：“你为什么要求这样一件朴素的事情？为什么不追求6米或7米？”正如委员会成员温迪·弗里德曼（WendyFreedman）所记得的那样，“戈尔丁本质上说，‘你们真是一群胆小鬼。’”他得到了全场起立鼓掌。“在我看来，他救了望远镜，”伊利沃思说。它会更大。毕竟，它也必须折叠起来。

After some heady talk about 8 meters, in 2001 NASA finally settled on 6.5 meters for the segmented mirror’s diameter, giving the next-generation telescope more than six times Hubble’s light-collecting area. The question was: How can you fit a 6.5-meter-wide mirror in a 5.4-meter-wide rocket fairing?&nbsp;2001年，美国国家航空航天局（NASA）在进行了一番关于8米的令人兴奋的讨论后，最终确定了6.5米的分段镜直径，使下一代望远镜的集光面积达到哈勃望远镜的六倍以上。问题是：如何在5.4米宽的火箭整流罩中安装6.5米宽的镜子？&nbsp;

“A big part of the design is how do you fold it up,” Mather said. Outside contractors developed competing mirror designs. Lockheed Martin’s mirror folded like six petals of a flower, Ball Aerospace’s like a drop-leaf tabletop. TRW proposed putting mirror segments in place the way an old jukebox puts records down. After mulling over the proposals for a year, Mather and his team adopted bits and pieces from each. The main contract went to TRW because of the company’s extensive experience building complex satellites for the U.S. military and its successful construction of the Chandra X-ray observatory. (TRW was soon purchased by Northrop Grumman.) The mirror design would be closer to Ball Aerospace’s: an array of 18 hexagonal segments forming a larger hexagon that would fold on two sides. Mike Menzel, who spearheaded Lockheed Martin’s proposal, was brought on by NASA as Webb’s chief engineer.马瑟说：“设计的很大一部分是如何折叠它。”。外部承包商开发了相互竞争的镜子设计。洛克希德·马丁公司的镜子折叠起来像一朵花的六片花瓣，鲍尔航天公司的镜子折叠起来像一个落叶桌面。TRW建议将镜像段放置到位，就像旧自动存储塔放置记录一样。在仔细考虑了一年的提案后，马瑟和他的团队采纳了每个提案的零碎部分。由于TRW公司为美国军方建造复杂卫星的丰富经验以及成功建造钱德拉X射线天文台，该公司获得了主合同。（TRW很快被诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司收购。）镜子的设计将更接近Ball Aerospace：由18个六边形组成的阵列，形成一个更大的六边形，可以在两侧折叠。迈克·门泽尔是洛克希德·马丁公司提案的牵头人，由美国宇航局任命为韦伯的首席工程师。

The mirrors would be made of beryllium — light, strong, stiff stuff that’s toxic in powder form (“Beryllium is a pain in the neck, but it’s the only thing that would work,” according to Mather). Powdered beryllium was pressed into blocks in Ohio, then cut to shape in Alabama. The 18 mirror segments were then topped with a layer of gold, which is supremely reflective of infrared light, and polished in a California factory built specifically for the purpose. “Shaping and polishing telescope mirrors is a dark art that goes back hundreds of years,” said Sarah Kendrew, a Belgian-British astronomer who works on MIRI, one of Webb’s instruments.镜子将由铍制成，铍是一种轻质、坚固、坚硬的粉末状有毒物质（“铍是颈部的痛，但它是唯一有效的东西，”马瑟说）。铍粉在俄亥俄州被压制成块，然后在阿拉巴马州被切割成型。然后，在18块镜面上涂上一层黄金，这层黄金对红外光具有极高的反射能力，并在加利福尼亚州一家专门为此目的建造的工厂进行抛光。“塑造和抛光望远镜镜子是一门可以追溯到数百年前的黑暗艺术，”从事韦伯仪器之一MIRI研究的比利时-英国天文学家莎拉·肯德鲁（SarahKendrew）说。

Motors with unprecedented finesse would be needed to bring the hexagonal mirror segments into collective focus in space. “That’s something we had to invent right away,” Mather said. “If you can’t do that, you can’t make the whole observatory work.” Ball Aerospace delivered actuators capable of nudging each of the gold hexagons in 10-nanometer increments, one ten-thousandth the width of a hair. Mather said the motors work by “flexing,” or “converting a big motion into a tiny motion,” though Ball’s design, despite being taxpayer-funded, is proprietary. “When we take a picture of the telescope we have to make sure no one could see the motors,” he said.为了将六边形反射镜的各个部分集中在太空中，需要有前所未有的精密马达。马瑟说：“这是我们必须马上发明的东西。”。“如果你做不到这一点，你就无法让整个天文台工作。”Ball航空航天公司提供的致动器能够以10纳米的增量轻推每个金六边形，即头发宽度的万分之一。马瑟说，尽管鲍尔的设计是由纳税人出资的，但它的工作原理是“弯曲”或“将大运动转化为小运动”。“当我们给望远镜拍照时，我们必须确保没有人能看到马达，”他说。

In 2002, the telescope got a name. NASA administrator Sean O’Keefe broke a tradition of naming telescopes for scientists — the Hubble telescope, for instance, refers to the American astronomer Edwin Hubble — and instead honored an earlier administrator, James Webb, who was head of the space agency during the Apollo era. The choice was immediately unpopular with astronomers and has grown increasingly so. Last year, [1,200 astronomers signed a petition](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02678-1 ) to rename the telescope after claims that Webb either aided or chose to ignore the firing of gay government employees during the Lavender Scare. After an investigation, NASA announced in October that historians found no evidence warranting a name change.&nbsp;2002年，该望远镜获得了一个名称。美国国家航空航天局局长肖恩·奥基夫打破了为科学家命名望远镜的传统——例如，哈勃望远镜是指美国天文学家埃德温·哈勃——而是向早些时候的局长詹姆斯·韦伯致敬，詹姆斯·韦伯是阿波罗时代航天局局长。这一选择立即不受天文学家的欢迎，而且越来越不受欢迎。去年，1200名天文学家签署了一份请愿书，要求对这架望远镜进行重新命名。此前，韦伯声称，在薰衣草恐慌期间，韦伯要么协助，要么选择无视同性恋政府雇员被解雇的事实。经过调查，美国国家航空航天局于10月宣布，历史学家没有发现任何证据证明有必要更改名称。&nbsp;

Various institutions, from the University of Arizona to the European Space Agency, signed up to build the cameras, spectrographs and coronagraphs that will swivel into place at the focal point of the optics, slicing and dicing different chunks of the pooled infrared light. In exchange, these institutional partners will command extensive telescope time.&nbsp;从亚利桑那州大学到欧洲航天局，各个机构都签约建造相机、光谱仪和日冕仪，这些相机、光谱仪和日冕仪将在光学焦点处旋转到位，对汇集的红外光进行切片和切割。作为交换，这些机构合作伙伴将需要大量的望远镜时间。&nbsp;

As for the sunshield, the flimsy material on which the infrared telescope’s fate rests, the team quickly settled on Kapton, a slithery silver plastic that looks like the inside of a potato chip bag but has the thickness of a human hair. Since it might tear, the sunshield would need many layers for redundancy — the team decided on five — and the layers would have to be unfurled, separated and held taut by a system of booms, cables and strings. Propulsion systems and solar panels would go on the sunward side, and the optics and instruments, which must operate below minus 223 degrees Celsius, would huddle on the dark side. “JWST has a lot of firsts, an awful lot of significant firsts,” Menzel, the chief engineer, told me, “but that sunshield is one of them.”至于遮阳板，红外望远镜的命运取决于其脆弱的材料，研究小组很快确定了卡普顿，一种光滑的银色塑料，看起来像薯片袋的内部，但有人的头发那么厚。由于它可能会撕裂，遮阳板将需要许多层来进行冗余——团队决定了五层——并且这些层必须展开、分开，并由吊杆、电缆和绳索系统拉紧。推进系统和太阳能电池板将位于向阳侧，光学和仪器必须在零下223摄氏度以下工作，将挤在黑暗侧。“JWST有很多第一，很多重要的第一，”总工程师Menzel告诉我，“但遮阳板就是其中之一。”

Michael Menzel of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center is the lead mission systems engineer for the Webb telescope — the chief engineer for the project.美国宇航局戈达德太空飞行中心的迈克尔·门泽尔是韦伯望远镜的首席任务系统工程师，也是该项目的首席工程师。

Menzel, who is thickset with a neatly clipped gray beard, oversees thousands of people’s work on one of the most complicated engineering projects in history; he’s also the type of person who tells you right away where they’re from. That would be Elizabeth, New Jersey — Exit 13 off the turnpike — where his father drove a cab. On a recent Zoom call, Menzel bent his arm back and forth at the elbow to explain the challenge presented by the sunshield. “If you take something rigid, like a door, and you build a nice hinge, you can predict the way that moves,” he said. “That’s a piece of cake.” He stopped bending his arm. “Now you got blankets. They’re floppy. Try to push on a blanket on your bed and predict the shape that it’s going to go in. It’s horrible. Same thing with a string — the strings that tension [the sunshield]. There’s a million different ways that a string can move.” It gets worse: “Now put all this experience in zero-G, where that stuff can go in places you just don’t want it to go.” Smoothly unfolding the sunshield “becomes a very tough problem.”&nbsp;门泽尔（Menzel）头发浓密，留着修剪整齐的灰色胡须，监督着数千人在历史上最复杂的工程项目之一上的工作；他也是那种能马上告诉你他们来自哪里的人。那将是新泽西州伊丽莎白市，收费公路13号出口，他的父亲在那里开出租车。在最近的一次Zoom通话中，Menzel在肘部来回弯曲手臂，解释遮阳板带来的挑战。他说：“如果你拿一些坚硬的东西，比如门，然后做一个漂亮的铰链，你就可以预测它的运动方式。”。“那是小菜一碟。”他不再弯曲手臂。“现在你有了毛毯。它们是松软的。试着把毛毯推到床上，预测它的形状。这太可怕了。绳子也是一样的——拉紧（遮阳板）的绳子。绳子可以有一百万种不同的移动方式。”更糟的是：“现在把所有这些经验放在零重力环境中，这些东西可以放在你不想去的地方。”顺利打开遮阳板“成为一个非常棘手的问题。”&nbsp;

Around 2004, the NASA engineers Chuck Perrygo and Keith Parrish came into Menzel’s office at Goddard and said they had a way to do it. Perrygo picked up a piece of paper on Menzel’s desk and folded it into the shape of a Z. The sunshield could be folded into many more such zigzags, in what’s sometimes called an accordion fold. “I’m pretty good at recognizing a bad answer, and I’m pretty good at recognizing a right answer,” Menzel told me, holding up a piece of paper he had folded into a Z shape. “So we all saw that and thought, that’s a way to pursue it.” Northrop Grumman was separately coming to the same conclusion.&nbsp;2004年左右，美国宇航局的工程师查克·佩里戈和基思·帕里什来到门泽尔在戈达德的办公室，说他们有办法做到这一点。Perrygo在Menzel的桌子上拿起一张纸，把它折成Z字形。遮阳板可以折成更多这样的之字形，有时被称为手风琴折叠。“我很擅长识别错误的答案，也很擅长识别正确的答案，”Menzel告诉我，他举起一张折叠成Z形的纸。“因此，我们都看到了这一点，并认为，这是一种追求它的方式。”诺斯罗普·格鲁曼分别得出了相同的结论。&nbsp;

The next question was how to hold the accordion fold in place until the sunshield was ready to unfurl. A Northrop Grumman engineer, Andy Tao, found the solution: 107 pins that retract like a cat’s claws.&nbsp;下一个问题是如何将手风琴的折叠固定到位，直到遮阳板准备展开。诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司（NorthropGrumman）的工程师安迪·陶（AndyTao）找到了解决方案：107个销可以像猫爪一样缩回。&nbsp;

The pin approach sprouted another tricky problem: pins make pinholes. If, after unfurling, pinholes on all five Kapton layers were to line up, this would let a sunbeam through, heating the optics. “It was one of those arcane little details that you’d never guess until you start getting into it and you start finding out, ah, Christ, five of the pinholes are lining right up and that’s going to let sunlight right in,” Menzel said. “It doesn’t sound like much, but it was driving Andy to drink. And God bless him, he figured it out.” Tao diligently sought out a suitable configuration of pins so that the holes in the five slightly-different-size Kapton layers would never align from any angle.&nbsp;pin方法引发了另一个棘手的问题：pin生成针孔。如果展开后，所有五个卡普顿层上的针孔都排成一行，这将让阳光穿过，加热光学元件。曼泽尔说：“这是一个神秘的小细节，你永远猜不到，直到你开始深入其中，你开始发现，啊，天哪，五个针孔排成一排，这样会让阳光直射进来。”。“听起来不多，但这让安迪很想喝酒。上帝保佑他，他终于明白了。”陶孜孜不倦地寻找一种合适的引脚配置，以便五个尺寸略有不同的卡普顿层中的孔永远不会从任何角度对齐。&nbsp;

The moles were being whacked so slowly that astronomers began referring to the situation as “the JWST problem.” Back in 1996, Mather and his team estimated that the telescope would cost $564 million — a somewhat disingenuous guess aimed at getting Congress on board — and that it would launch in 2007. As the price tag soared and the launch date hopped ever farther into the future, Congress grew impatient. In 2011, JWST was nearly canceled, but elementary school students wrote letters to Washington and Senator Mikulski again came to NASA’s rescue.&nbsp;摩尔被撞击的速度非常慢，天文学家开始将这种情况称为“JWST问题”早在1996年，马瑟和他的团队就估计这台望远镜将耗资5.64亿美元——这是一个有点虚假的猜测，目的是让国会参与进来——并预计将于2007年发射。随着价格的飙升和发射日期的提前，国会变得越来越不耐烦。2011年，JWST差点被取消，但小学生们写信给华盛顿，参议员Mikulski再次前来美国宇航局救援。&nbsp;

Glass, metal and plastic gradually got bolted together in clean rooms at Goddard, Northrop Grumman, Ball Aerospace and elsewhere. But the assembled hardware couldn’t simply be sent skyward, because the telescope is going a million miles away, where astronauts with wrenches can’t visit. As Northrop Grumman engineer Jon Arenberg once put it, “This is a one-strike-and-you’re-out business.” Webb must deploy flawlessly on the first and only try. That means it had to be extensively, painstakingly tested on the ground. And in 2017 and 2018, these tests turned up one problem after another.&nbsp;玻璃、金属和塑料逐渐在戈达德、诺斯罗普·格鲁曼、鲍尔航空和其他地方的洁净室中固定在一起。但组装好的硬件不能简单地送上天空，因为望远镜要飞到100万英里以外，带扳手的宇航员无法到达那里。正如诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司（NorthropGrumman）的工程师乔恩·阿伦伯格（JonArenberg）所言，“这是一次罢工，你就完了。”Webb必须在第一次也是唯一一次尝试中完美部署。这意味着它必须在实地进行广泛、艰苦的测试。2017年和2018年，这些测试出现了一个又一个问题。&nbsp;

After a “shake test,” a bunch of screws and washers that had held the sunshield cover in place were found on the floor; they hadn’t been properly torqued. Another time, the sunshield caught on a snag and tore. Once, it unfolded, but not without a string wrapping around something it shouldn’t have.&nbsp;在“震动测试”后，在地板上发现了一堆将遮阳板盖固定到位的螺钉和垫圈；它们没有被正确拧紧。另一次，遮阳板被绊住并撕裂。有一次，它展开了，但不是没有一根绳子包裹着它不应该有的东西。&nbsp;

The telescope got in another scrape when it was shipped to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, placed in the chamber where Apollo astronauts once practiced their moonwalks, and cryogenically cooled to simulate the conditions of outer space. While instrument builders like Sarah Kendrew were testing the cold hardware, Hurricane Harvey hit. The whole city catastrophically flooded, but the biggest worry for the Webb team was the liquid nitrogen supply. If it ran out, the telescope’s temperature would rise too quickly, damaging the instruments. The liquid nitrogen suppliers had to be urged to send trucks through the floodwaters as a matter of national importance.&nbsp;这台望远镜在运送到休斯顿约翰逊航天中心时又遇到了麻烦，该中心位于阿波罗宇航员曾经进行月球行走的舱内，并经过低温冷却以模拟外层空间的条件。当像莎拉·肯德鲁这样的仪器制造商在测试低温硬件时，飓风哈维袭击了他们。整个城市都发生了灾难性的洪水，但韦伯团队最担心的是液氮供应。如果用完了，望远镜的温度会上升得太快，损坏仪器。作为国家大事，必须敦促液氮供应商派遣卡车通过洪水。&nbsp;

![The telescope’s hexagonal mirror is shown on its way out of a huge vault.](https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2021/12/JWST_Cryo-Testing_2K.jpg )

The Webb telescope emerged from a vacuum chamber at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston on December 1, 2017, after about 100 days of cryogenic testing. Hurricane Harvey raged outside while the telescope experienced a cold, airless environment akin to that of space.2017年12月1日，经过大约100天的低温测试后，韦伯望远镜从休斯顿NASA约翰逊航天中心的真空室中出现。飓风哈维在室外肆虐，而望远镜经历了一个类似于太空的寒冷、无空气的环境。

Problems continued. Earlier this year, the transponders that will blip data back to Earth were found to be faulty and had to be repaired. “A delay causes its own cascade of issues,” Tremblay said — and more expense: “It costs $10 million a month just to keep James Webb on the clean room floor.” As the investment rose, so did the need for the mission to succeed. “If NASA was willing to accept more risk, JWST would have been half the cost,” Tremblay explained.&nbsp;问题仍然存在。今年早些时候，将数据发送回地球的转发器被发现有故障，必须进行维修。特雷姆布雷说：“延误会引发一连串的问题，而且还会带来更多的费用：“仅仅为了让詹姆斯·韦伯保持洁净，每月就要花费1000万美元。”随着投资的增加，特派团取得成功的必要性也随之增加。“如果NASA愿意接受更多的风险，JWST将是成本的一半，”特雷姆布雷解释道。&nbsp;

Finally, problems abated. Northrop Grumman engineers successfully unfolded the sunshield several times at its facility in Redondo Beach, California. But according to Menzel, even after the shimmery layers have spread smoothly open, “we aren’t as elated as you might think. Because we all know that sunshield will only be as good as the last time it’s folded.”&nbsp;最后，问题有所缓解。诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司（NorthropGrumman）的工程师在其位于加利福尼亚州雷东多海滩（RedondoBeach）的工厂多次成功地打开了遮阳板。但据门泽尔说，即使在闪光层顺利展开之后，“我们也不会像你想象的那样兴高采烈。因为我们都知道，遮阳板只有在最后一次折叠时才会有那么好的效果。”&nbsp;

Webb’s final cost approaches $10 billion. That’s nearly 20 times its sticker price, but still a few billion less than an aircraft carrier. Following some final pandemic-related delays, late 2021 became its target launch date. In September, the telescope passed a final test in Redondo Beach: Gold ears pinned back and blanket stashed away, the whole observatory was turned on its side, then righted, then checked to see whether anything had changed. Then it was put back on its side into a shipping container and taken away. Garth Illingworth, who has been involved with the telescope in a range of capacities since the beginning, went to Redondo Beach to see it off. There it had stood, “tall and majestic,” he wrote in an email. “By the next day the clean room was even empty of any JWST-related support hardware.” The exact date of the shipping container’s departure from California was kept quiet — a precaution against piracy on the high seas — but in early October it voyaged through the Panama Canal to French Guiana, a region near the equator where the European Space Agency launches its plus-size Ariane 5 rocket to exploit the extra kick of Earth’s rotation.&nbsp;韦伯的最终成本接近100亿美元。这几乎是其标价的20倍，但仍比航空母舰少几十亿。在一些与大流行相关的最终延迟之后，2021晚些时候成为其目标发射日期。9月，该望远镜在雷东多海滩通过了最后一次测试：金色的耳朵被钉住，毯子被藏起来，整个天文台被翻转过来，然后竖直，然后检查是否有任何变化。然后，它被放回船运集装箱并带走。加思·伊林沃思（GarthIllingworth）从一开始就参与了该望远镜的一系列工作，他前往雷东多海滩送行。他在一封电子邮件中写道：“它矗立在那里，高大威严。”。“第二天，洁净室甚至没有任何与JWST相关的支持硬件。”集装箱离开加利福尼亚州的确切日期一直保持沉默，这是为了防止公海上的海盗行为，但在10月初，集装箱通过巴拿马运河航行到法属圭亚那，这是一个靠近赤道的地区，欧洲航天局在那里发射了超大型Ariane 5火箭，以利用地球自转的额外推力。&nbsp;

The Webb team is busy rehearsing the routines they’ll execute 24/7 out of Baltimore during Webb’s monthlong journey to Lagrange point 2, followed by its five-month commissioning period. “Do I feel confident?” said Menzel. “Yes. I feel confident that we’ve done everything we possibly could. The risk is acceptably low. It’s as good as it’s going to be. And I’m pretty confident that we’re going to do fine.&nbsp;Webb团队正忙于排练在Webb前往Lagrange point 2的为期一个月的旅程中，他们将在巴尔的摩7天24小时执行的例行程序，然后是为期五个月的调试期。“我有信心吗？”门泽尔说。“是的。我相信我们已经尽了一切可能。风险是可以接受的低。它将是最好的。我很有信心我们会做得很好。”

“Could something go wrong? Hell, yeah.”“会出什么事吗？见鬼，是的。”

## **Reasonable Guesses**

Once the Hubble got working, humanity soaked up the sight of the cosmos like near-sighted kids wearing glasses for the first time. We also learned there was stuff out there that we couldn’t see.&nbsp;一旦哈勃望远镜开始工作，人类第一次像戴眼镜的近视儿童一样吸收了宇宙的景象。我们还了解到，那里有我们看不到的东西。&nbsp;

In 1998, two rival teams of astronomers used the Hubble along with other telescopes to observe supernovas in distant galaxies and ascertain that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. This exposed the existence of an accelerating agent infusing all of space, known as dark energy. There’s so much space that dark energy makes up 70% of everything. (Another 26% is dark matter, and 4% is luminous atoms and radiation.)&nbsp;1998年，两个对立的天文学家小组利用哈勃望远镜和其他望远镜观察遥远星系中的超新星，并确定宇宙正在加速膨胀。这暴露了一种注入整个空间的加速剂的存在，即暗能量。空间太大了，暗能量占了所有能量的70%。（另外26%是暗物质，4%是发光原子和辐射。）&nbsp;

Other puzzles soon turned up. The astronomer Wendy Freedman used Hubble to observe pulsating stars called cepheids. From these, in 2001 she and her team measured how fast the universe is currently expanding, achieving 10% accuracy, a huge improvement over previous measurements. In the years since Freedman’s measurement, the cosmic expansion rate has landed at the center of [the biggest controversy in cosmology](https://www.quantamagazine.org/cosmologists-debate-how-fast-the-universe-is-expanding-20190808/ ). The issue is that, based on the universe’s known ingredients and governing equations, theorists infer that space should currently be expanding more slowly than the measurements suggest. Its fast expansion may point to additional unknown ingredients in the cosmos beyond dark matter and dark energy. But Freedman, who is calm and authoritative, isn’t convinced yet that the measurements are right. She’ll lead a team that will use the Webb telescope to scrutinize cepheids and other stars more closely; they hope to measure the expansion rate precisely enough to tell for sure whether there’s an exotic fundamental ingredient afoot.其他谜题很快就出现了。天文学家温迪·弗里德曼（WendyFreedman）利用哈勃望远镜观察了一种名为造父变星的脉动恒星。2001年，她和她的团队通过这些数据测量了宇宙目前的膨胀速度，达到了10%的准确率，比之前的测量结果有了巨大的改进。自弗里德曼测量以来的几年里，宇宙膨胀率一直是宇宙学最大争议的焦点。问题是，根据已知的宇宙成分和控制方程，理论家推断，目前空间的膨胀速度应该比测量结果所显示的要慢。它的快速膨胀可能指向宇宙中除了暗物质和暗能量之外的其他未知成分。但冷静而权威的弗里德曼还不相信这些测量结果是正确的。她将领导一个团队，使用韦伯望远镜更仔细地观察造父变星和其他恒星；他们希望能够精确地测量膨胀率，以确定是否有一种奇特的基本成分正在形成。

Meanwhile, the Hubble Deep Field photo told a rollicking story of galaxy evolution that dramatically expanded human knowledge of cosmic history. But it remains to Webb to read the crucial first couple of chapters of the story.与此同时，哈勃的深场照片讲述了一个银河系演化的精彩故事，极大地扩展了人类对宇宙历史的认识。但韦伯仍需阅读故事中至关重要的前几章。

Marcia Rieke, a longtime professor at the University of Arizona regarded as one of the pioneers of infrared astronomy, has spent the last 20 years overseeing the design and construction of NIRCam (as in “near-infrared camera”), one of Webb’s four main instruments. She and her team at Arizona are planning to use more than half of their whopping 900 hours of guaranteed telescope time to do a new deep-field survey, one that will peer deeper into the past than ever before. Whereas Hubble could see the faint smudges of galaxies at redshift 10, corresponding to 500 million years after the Big Bang, Webb should be able to see those smudges very clearly and spot brand-new galaxies germinating farther away, perhaps as far back as 50 or 100 million years after the Big Bang.马西娅·里克（MarciaRieke）是亚利桑那州大学（University of Arizona）的长期教授，被视为红外天文学的先驱之一。在过去20年中，她一直在监督NIRCam（如“近红外照相机”）的设计和建造，NIRCam是韦伯的四大主要仪器之一。她和她在亚利桑那州的团队计划利用他们保证的900小时望远镜时间中的一半以上进行一次新的深部实地调查，这将比以往任何时候都更深入地审视过去。哈勃可以在红移10处看到星系的模糊污迹，对应于宇宙大爆炸后5亿年，而韦伯应该能够非常清楚地看到这些污迹，并发现在更远的地方发芽的全新星系，可能要追溯到宇宙大爆炸后5000万年或1亿年。

Rieke and her team will do one better than the Hubble deep field. After using NIRCam to get an image of their dark patch of the sky, they’ll identify the galaxies in the patch that are farthest away and use NIRSpec, Webb’s near-infrared spectrograph, to take the galaxies’ spectra, from which Rieke and her colleagues can deduce their chemical compositions. Rieke和她的团队将比哈勃深场做得更好。在使用NIRCam获得天空中暗斑的图像后，他们将确定斑中距离最远的星系，并使用Webb的近红外光谱仪NIRSpec获取星系的光谱，Rieke和她的同事可以从中推断出它们的化学成分。

The spectrum will show which elements of the periodic table existed in each proto-galaxy, and how their elements evolved over time. The standard story is that early gas clouds, stars and galaxies mostly consisted of hydrogen, and supernovas and other explosive events gradually forged heavier elements. “But there are curious things,” Rieke said. “Close to the limit that Hubble can go to, there are quasars” — super-bright centers of galaxies powered by supermassive black holes — “and it looks like they have almost the same elements as the sun. Which is hard to believe. So there’s something that goes on early that we don’t have a good handle on.”光谱将显示每个原始星系中存在的周期表元素，以及它们的元素是如何随时间演化的。标准的说法是，早期的气体云、恒星和星系大多由氢组成，而超新星和其他爆炸事件逐渐形成了较重的元素。“但有一些奇怪的事情，”Rieke说。“接近哈勃所能达到的极限，存在着类星体”——由超大质量黑洞驱动的星系的超亮中心——“看起来它们的元素几乎与太阳相同。这很难相信。因此，有一些早期发生的事情我们没有很好的把握。”

There are as many reasons for wanting to see the first stars and galaxies as there are astronomers, astrophysicists and cosmologists. For Risa Wechsler, a cosmologist at Stanford University, it’s a way to watch dark matter’s handiwork. She and her colleagues will use the proto-galaxies to deduce the distribution of sizes of dark matter halos that must have existed in the early universe, and when they formed. This can reveal whether dark matter is “cold,” that is, made of slow-moving particles, or “warm,” since particles that whizz around would have taken longer to huddle into halos. This temperature check would be a significant clue to dark matter’s nature.想要看到第一批恒星和星系的原因和天文学家、天体物理学家和宇宙学家一样多。对于斯坦福大学的宇宙学家Risa Wechsler来说，这是一种观察暗物质的方法。她和她的同事将利用原星系推断出早期宇宙中一定存在的暗物质晕的大小分布，以及它们形成的时间。这可以揭示暗物质是“冷”的，也就是说，是由缓慢移动的粒子组成的，还是“热”的，因为在周围呼啸的粒子会花更长的时间聚集成晕。这一温度检查将是了解暗物质性质的重要线索。

Other researchers want to understand the first stars. Some think Webb will see so-called “Population III stars,” primordial beasts that are hypothesized to have been roughly 10,000 times heavier than our sun. Such stars would help solve another major mystery of galaxy formation: how galaxies’ centers ended up with supermassive black holes — physically small yet incredibly powerful gravitational sinkholes that can weigh billions of times the mass of our sun. Nobody knows how supermassive black holes grew so heavy, or when, or why their properties are correlated with properties of their host galaxies. One theory is that Population III stars seeded the holes, but there are a million other theories. Webb will look for signatures of the different scenarios.其他研究人员想了解第一颗恒星。一些人认为，韦伯将看到所谓的“第三种群恒星”，这是一种原始的野兽，据推测其重量大约是我们太阳的10000倍。这类恒星将有助于解开星系形成的另一个主要谜团：星系中心如何最终形成超大质量黑洞——物理上很小，但强大得令人难以置信的引力天坑，其质量可以达到太阳质量的数十亿倍。没有人知道超大质量黑洞是如何变得如此之重的，也没有人知道它们的性质是什么时候变大的，也没有人知道为什么它们的性质与宿主星系的性质相关。一种理论认为，第三类恒星是黑洞的种子，但还有一百万种其他理论。韦伯将寻找不同场景的特征。

Theorists have simulated many possibilities for how structures might have emerged in the young universe. But they can’t simply start with the cosmic microwave background and evolve that picture forward on the computer to see what happened. “A lot of the initial conditions are not well understood — things like the magnetic field, and how much turbulence there is in the gas,” said Peter Behroozi, a theorist colleague of Rieke’s at Arizona who simulates star and galaxy formation. It’s “a lot of work,” he said, to get from a large, ever-so-slightly dense spot in the cosmic microwave background to a tiny cloud of gas that will gravitationally contract and make a star.理论家们模拟了年轻宇宙中可能出现的结构的许多可能性。但他们不能简单地从宇宙微波背景开始，然后在计算机上将图像向前演化，以了解发生了什么。“很多初始条件都不太清楚，比如磁场，以及气体中有多少湍流，”Rieke在亚利桑那州的理论家同事PeterBehroozi说，他模拟了恒星和星系的形成。他说，要从宇宙微波背景中的一个大而稍密的点变成一个微小的气体云需要“大量的工作”，气体云将在引力作用下收缩并形成恒星。

“Oftentimes what people will do is, they’ll just skip that,” Behroozi said, and “start with a spherical cloud of gas. They don’t know what the distribution of [dark matter] clump sizes will be, so they guess. They don’t know about the magnetic field; they don’t know anything about the spin or turbulence of the gas, so they’ll fill all that in with guesses.”&nbsp;贝鲁齐说：“人们通常会跳过这一步，”然后“从球状气体云开始。他们不知道[暗物质]团块大小的分布，所以他们猜测。他们不知道磁场；他们不知道气体的自旋或湍流，所以他们会用猜测来填补这一切。”&nbsp;

The guesswork has accelerated recently as researchers race to get their predictions on record before Webb shows how star and galaxy formation really went down. Even conservative guesses can produce simulations with wildly different outcomes. “The main conclusion from my research,” Behroozi said, “is even if you try to make a reasonable guess, we still have no clue what James Webb will see.”最近，随着研究人员争先恐后地将他们的预测记录在案，在韦伯展示恒星和星系形成如何真正下降之前，猜测的速度加快了。即使是保守的猜测也可能产生结果迥然不同的模拟结果。贝鲁齐说：“我的研究得出的主要结论是，即使你试图做出合理的猜测，我们仍然不知道詹姆斯·韦伯会看到什么。”

## **Bridge Planets**

Natasha Batalha, Natalie Batalha’s second child, was 18 when she went to Florida for the Kepler launch. She remembers tagging along with her younger sister in the viewing room where the NASA science team had gathered. “During the launch, the anxiety that was in that space was chilling,” she said on a recent video call. After liftoff, the scene turned jubilant. She found it inspiring to see a team accomplish something so grand, but it was the possibility of discoveries being so close at hand “that was really what flipped on my brain to start thinking about exoplanets as a concept,” said Natasha Batalha, who is serious and precise, like her mother.&nbsp;娜塔莎·巴塔利亚（NatashaBatalha）是娜塔莉·巴塔利亚的第二个孩子，她18岁时前往佛罗里达州参加开普勒发射仪式。她记得自己和妹妹一起在NASA科学团队聚集的观察室里。她在最近的一次视频通话中说：“在发射期间，太空中的焦虑令人心寒。”。升空后，场面变得喜气洋洋。娜塔莎·巴塔哈（Natasha Batalha）说，看到一个团队完成了如此宏大的成就，她感到很鼓舞，但发现的可能性如此之近，“这真的让我的大脑开始思考将系外行星作为一个概念，”她和她母亲一样严肃而精确。&nbsp;

Space wasn’t a constant topic of discussion in the Batalha household. “I didn’t want to saturate their lives with science,” Natalie Batalha said. “I always wanted them to feel like they were number one.” But she and Celso did have “a secret hope” about Natasha. One evening in 1996 while Celso was teaching a night class, Natalie loaded up the half-asleep kids to drive them to a meadow so they look for the passing comet Hyakutake. Before they’d pulled out of the driveway, five-year-old Natasha said from the back seat: “What’s that?” She was pointing at the comet.在巴塔利亚家庭，空间并不是一个经常讨论的话题。娜塔莉·巴塔利亚说：“我不想让他们的生活充斥着科学。”。“我一直想让他们觉得自己是头号人物。”但她和塞尔索确实对娜塔莎抱有“秘密的希望”。1996年的一个晚上，塞尔索在上夜校，娜塔莉载着半睡半醒的孩子们开车去草地，让他们寻找路过的慧星海亚库塔克。在他们驶出车道之前，五岁的娜塔莎从后座上说：“那是什么？”她指着彗星。

When Natasha was eight and living in Brazil, her mother asked her and her siblings to draw an astronomer. Natasha drew a white man, and Natalie asked her why. “This was crazy for me, the daughter of a Latinx scientist and a female scientist; I still had these stereotypes ingrained in my mind,” Natasha said. She suddenly felt empowered by the thought that she could belong in science.娜塔莎八岁时住在巴西，她的母亲让她和她的兄弟姐妹画一个天文学家。娜塔莎画了一个白人，娜塔莉问她为什么。娜塔莎说：“这对我来说太疯狂了，我是一位拉丁裔科学家和一位女科学家的女儿；我的脑海中仍然根深蒂固这些刻板印象。”。她突然觉得自己可以归属于科学界，这让她有了力量。

A couple of years later she read Sally Ride’s autobiography. Just as her mother had been inspired by Ride, Natasha decided to become either an astronomer or an astronaut. She dreamed of being the first person on Mars. After the Kepler launch, as more and more exoplanets were discovered, she grew interested in the possibility of extraterrestrial life and how we might infer its presence on those planets through telescope observations of their skies. She got a dual Ph.D. in astronomy and astrobiology. Then, soon after Kepler ended and her mom left NASA Ames to become a professor at Santa Cruz, Natasha took a job at Ames studying exoplanet atmospheres.&nbsp;几年后，她读了萨莉·里德的自传。正如她的母亲受到里德的启发一样，娜塔莎决定要么成为天文学家，要么成为宇航员。她梦想成为火星上的第一人。开普勒发射后，随着越来越多的系外行星被发现，她对地外生命的可能性以及我们如何通过望远镜观察这些行星的天空来推断其存在感兴趣。她获得了天文学和天体生物学的双博士学位。然后，开普勒结束后不久，她的母亲离开美国宇航局艾姆斯成为圣克鲁斯的教授，娜塔莎在艾姆斯找到了一份研究系外行星大气的工作。&nbsp;

Natasha Batalha is part of a growing research community whose ultimate goal is to detect “[biosignature gases](https://www.quantamagazine.org/scientists-debate-signatures-of-alien-life-20160202/ )” — gases in a planet’s atmosphere that could only be there because of life. Every kind of molecule has characteristic wavelengths that it absorbs. So by collecting light from a star when a planet is and isn’t transiting in front of it, and checking which wavelengths of starlight grow dimmer when the planet is there, you can see which molecules are present in the planet’s sky.&nbsp;娜塔莎·巴塔利亚（NatashaBatalha）是一个不断壮大的研究团体的一员，该团体的最终目标是探测“生物信号气体”——一个行星大气层中的气体，因为生命的存在才可能存在。每种分子都有其吸收的特征波长。因此，当一颗行星正在或不在其前方过境时，通过收集恒星发出的光，并检查行星在那里时，哪些波长的星光变暗，你可以看到行星天空中存在哪些分子。&nbsp;

Oxygen is an obvious candidate for a biosignature gas: It’s so reactive that it’s unlikely to be found unless the planet’s oxygen supply is continually replenished by, say, a biosphere doing photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is such a simple and efficient energy-capturing procedure that astrobiologists think it’s likely to evolve on any living planet, so oxygen is smart to look for.&nbsp;氧气显然是生物标志气体的候选者：它的活性很强，除非地球的氧气供应不断得到生物圈的补充，比如说，进行光合作用的生物圈，否则不可能找到它。光合作用是一种简单而有效的能量捕获过程，天体生物学家认为它很可能在任何有生命的行星上进化，因此寻找氧气是明智的。&nbsp;

But seeing oxygen by itself wouldn’t necessarily be convincing. Computer simulations show that under some conditions, oxygen can fill the skies of lifeless planets. “The challenge is there’s not one gas that’s going to be a biosignature gas,” said Hammel, the planetary scientist. “Methane on Earth is mostly produced by cows … but you look at Neptune, and you can see tons of methane there, and that’s not produced by cows.”&nbsp;但仅仅看到氧气本身并不一定令人信服。计算机模拟表明，在某些条件下，氧气可以填满无生命行星的天空。行星科学家哈默尔说：“挑战在于，没有一种气体会成为生物签名气体。”。“地球上的甲烷主要是由奶牛产生的……但你看看海王星，你可以看到那里有成吨的甲烷，而这不是由奶牛产生的。”&nbsp;

A better biosignature is a peculiar mix of gases. “It’s not going to be a single gas, it’s going to have to be a combination of gases in a configuration that tells us they are in a disequilibrium state,” said Hammel. “They can’t have formed that way naturally.”更好的生物标志是一种特殊的气体混合物。哈默尔说：“这不是一种单一的气体，它必须是一种组合气体，其结构告诉我们它们处于不平衡状态。”。“他们不可能是自然形成的。”

Existing telescopes have already spotted molecular fingerprints in the skies of hot Jupiters, but these are lifeless planets. Detecting the weaker signals from rocky, possibly habitable planets’ skies will require JWST. Not only will the telescope have close to 100 times Hubble’s resolution, but it will see exoplanets far more clearly against the background of their host stars, since planets emit more infrared than optical light, while stars emit less. Importantly, Webb’s view of exoplanets won’t be obscured by clouds, which often prevent optical telescopes from seeing the densest, low-altitude layers of atmosphere. “Imagine being in a plane and looking down at an insane cloud deck, and you can’t see the surface at all,” Natasha Batalha said. “When you look at infrared light, you can all of a sudden see through the cloud deck.”

Exoplanets will be among the targets in JWST’s “Cycle 1” round of observations, which it will start tackling as soon as deployment and commissioning are complete — about six months after launch. The exoplanet community elected Natalie Batalha to lead transit spectroscopy studies of three gas giants as part of these early observations. Her team will also develop data pipelines and processing techniques for the community to copy.

Cycle 1 also includes observations for specific groups of astronomers. Last year, more than 2,000 groups submitted proposals to use JWST in the first cycle; a time allocation committee selected 266. Dozens of these programs will look at planets. When I video-chatted with Hammel, she screen-shared PowerPoint slides highlighting various exo-worlds of interest that Webb will turn its eye toward on behalf of different observers: Kepler 16b, which orbits two stars; the suspected “lava world” 55 Cancri e; and the seven rocky planets of the nearby Trappist-1 star system. (Hammel, who gets 100 hours of guaranteed observer time as a longtime member of the Webb science team, will browse our own solar system, including Jupiter’s red spot, the mysterious, far-flung objects of the Kuiper belt, and Hammel’s oft-overlooked favorites, Uranus and Neptune, which appeared as a pair of plush toys behind her on her office couch.)&nbsp;

Out of all the exoplanets that JWST will look at in Cycle 1, Natasha Batalha reckons that the three Trappist planets that orbit in their star’s habitable zone probably have the best shot at featuring detectable biosignature gases. “The Trappist system is unique in that the star is very small, and so the relative feature size of the atmospheres doesn’t need to be big in order for you to be able to see it,” she said. Whether Webb has a realistic chance of spotting biosignature gases is debatable, however. “Often the controversy comes up over the detection of oxygen,” she said. Oxygen absorbs one infrared wavelength in Webb’s range of sensitivity, and so theoretically an oxygen-rich transiting planet could put a noticeable dip in its star’s spectrum at that wavelength. “However,” she said, the wavelength “is just at the edge where the detector loses sensitivity.” Other types and combinations of gases will be easier to detect but might be harder to definitively attribute to life.&nbsp;

Webb might just identify possibly living planets, which would then be examined more closely with future space telescopes. Astronomers are busy planning those now. NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, slated to launch later this decade, is mostly designed to study dark energy; Earth-like exoplanets are the purview of a future telescope concept provisionally known as LuvEx, an ultraviolet, optical and IR telescope that (if funded by Congress) will launch in the mid-2040s.韦伯可能只是确定可能存在的行星，然后用未来的太空望远镜对其进行更仔细的检查。天文学家现在正忙于计划这些。美国宇航局的南希·格雷斯·罗曼太空望远镜计划于本世纪末发射，主要用于研究暗能量；类地系外行星是未来望远镜概念的范畴，该概念暂时被称为LuvEx，这是一种紫外线、光学和红外望远镜（如果由国会资助），将于20世纪40年代中期发射。

What we will look at then depends on what we learn in the next few years.那么我们将看什么取决于我们在未来几年里学到了什么。

One morning this spring, Natasha Batalha woke up to a text from fellow exoplanet astronomer Johanna Teske: “We got it!” The 266 selected Cycle 1 programs had just been announced, and a proposal led by Batalha, with Teske as her deputy, made the list.&nbsp;今年春天的一天早上，娜塔莎·巴塔利亚醒来时，看到了系外行星天文学家约翰娜·特斯克的一条短信：“我们成功了！”266个选定的第一周期项目刚刚宣布，由巴塔利亚领导的一项提案，特斯克作为她的副手，被列入名单。&nbsp;

Theirs will be the most extensive of all the exoplanet observing campaigns in the first cycle: a 142-hour survey of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, the ubiquitous midsize “bridge” planets that our solar system lacks, and whose composition, habitability and formation history are unknown. Assuming that, over the next few months, everything unfolds as it should and the James Webb Space Telescope finds its focus, it will point at 11 of these planets on behalf of Natasha Batalha and her team. When she awoke to the good news, first she called Teske. Then she called her mom.他们将是第一周期所有系外行星观测活动中最广泛的一次：对超级地球和次海王星进行长达142小时的观测，这些行星是我们太阳系所缺乏的无处不在的中型“桥梁”行星，其组成、可居住性和形成历史未知。假设在接下来的几个月里，一切都如期展开，詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜找到了它的焦点，它将代表娜塔莎·巴塔利亚和她的团队指向其中的11颗行星。当她听到这个好消息时，首先给特斯克打了电话。然后她打电话给她妈妈。
