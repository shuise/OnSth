古希腊著名的被剧作家索福克雷斯最著名的作品是《安提戈涅》，通过安提戈涅的悲剧描述了法律与道德的冲突，安提戈涅是俄狄浦斯（那位杀父娶母的人）的女儿。俄狄浦斯自我流放后，两个儿子争夺权力，互相杀死对方，其中一个儿子因为引援外国军队被城邦新国王（安提戈涅的舅舅）定为叛国者后被抛尸。国王勒令不可埋葬叛国者，但在古希腊地区，死人必须被下葬，否则就是触犯神灵。在这种冲突中，安提戈涅坚持认为国王法令不得高于神旨，坚持埋葬哥哥（虽然只是象征性的撒了几抔土），最后被国王处死。

这个问题就涉及到自然法的问题，根据维基百科解释“自然法是一种主张一定的权利因为人类本性中的美德而固然存在，由自然赋予（传统上由上帝或超然的来源），并且这些权利可以通过人类理性得到普遍理解的哲学。因为是由自然所决定的，自然法则被认为是客观和普遍的，它独立于人类的理解，以及特定国家，政治秩序，立法机构或整个社会的制定法而存在。”



自然法会更多植根于人的道德理念，社会法律体系原则上从属于自然法。如果二者一致，会显得合理合理，如果有冲突，就会出现法律上正确而大众无法接受，版权同样涉及到这个问题。



因为之前研究《海盗湾》，为啥叫海盗湾，这个名字还真是取的有水平，在英文中 pirate 一词既有海盗的意思，又有翻印盗版的含义，一语双光，直奔主题，同时又借用了海盗逍遥法律体系之外的感觉。看过一些资料，版权专利等也挺复杂的，边界模糊，充满争议，毫不夸张的讲，其实已经严重影响行业的发展。知乎副总裁张宁在《创作者》一书也谈到这个问题，前几天看到这篇文章，虽然没有给出答案，但剖析了一些思路，值得简介。

------------------

I have contrarian ideas on intellectual property. I’ve come to think that the natural home of ideas is in the commons, that they should not be “owned” for very long. My perspective is neither widespread, nor part of current law, nor have I seen it articulated elsewhere, but I think it might be a better alternative, so I am presenting it here.

我对于知识产权有不同的看法。我想创意从根本上是相通的，创意不应该被长期占有。我的想法并未受众广泛，也不是构成法律的一部分。我认为这也许描述了一个更好的将来，所以我把它写在这儿。



The default metaphor for intellectual property in modern times is “ownership.” In this model of ownership, all ideas, stories, inventions, characters, product names, techniques are understood to be inherently born as the property of their creator. 

现代 IP 最日常的隐喻是所有权。在这种所有权的模式中，所有的创意、故事、发明、角色、产品名称、技术都被认为是创作者的产出，从而完全属于创作者的资产。



These thoughts-made-real are seen to be owned by the mind that births them. You think them, you own them. With this status of ownership, intangible creations such as a novel, a musical melody, a plot, a phrase, formula, etc — all things created by a mind — are given a monopoly of rights in order to encourage further creations by the same creator. And to spur others to create. 

这些「心想事成」被认为完全属于产出他们的大脑。一个人想到了它们，就拥有了它们。在这种所有权的背景下，像小说、乐曲、构思、语句、方程式等无形资产，都赋予了创作者所有权，从而鼓励这个群体更多创意，刺激其他人创作。



This lawful monopoly — such as copyright, patents, trademarks — protects the creation from being used by others for gain. By current law, this inherent monopolistic ownership is held strongly for long periods of time, ranging from decades to a century, depending on the conceptual type (patents may be 17 years while copyright may exceed lifetimes). 

像版权、专利、商标这些法律垄断方式禁止其他人通过使用这些创作获益。基于当下法律，这些可继承的专有权可以持续很长时间，从几十年到一百年，具体取决于创意的形式。（专利也许 17 年，版权可以持续终身）。



This awarded monopoly has a few exceptions for very limited special cases, such as “fair use” and public domain. In these modes anyone can fairly use the invention for their own purposes. Certain restrictions may apply, like if the use might need to be for education, or for parody, or so used in a transformative way, or bettered by the use. These exceptions were to be kept to an absolute minimum in order to maximize the monopoly of the hard working creator.

这种垄断在某些特殊情况下也有例外，比如公共领域和公平使用。在这些情况下，任何人可以公平的使用之前的创作，用途当然也有严格的限制，比如可以用于教育、滑稽模仿，或者用于转化场景，或者使用可以使得原创作变的更好。为了更好的保护努力工作的创作者，专属权被最大可能的保护，同时也就尽可能的缩小例外的范围。



This framing plays into both the modern idea of ownership as the sacred foundation of wealth and prosperity, but it also plays into the idea of creator as a hero, or at least as the bedrock of progress.

这个框架同时扮演了两个角色，面向现代创意所有权的神圣私人财产制度以及面向创作者的庇护人，或者至少很坚定的支持了整个过程。



I believe this arrangement is misguided. The whole framework should be inverted. Public domain and fair use should be the default, and an IP monopoly should be the exception.

我相信这种安排被误导了，整个框架应该反转才对，公共领域和公平使用应该优先，IP专属权应该是例外。



We have tons of evidence today that independent simultaneous invention is the norm for ideas in science and technology and even to a surprising extent in literature and art. Most technical things, often even artistic things, are invented by more than one person, at the same time, independently. 

我们有大量的证据表明，独立的模拟创作、科技领域的想法，甚至是文艺领域的惊奇延伸，大多数技术甚至艺术，会同时被多个人独立的分别创作出来。



In other words if X did not create it, Y will soon afterwards, if he/she has not already invented it before. Further, we now know almost all “new” things are recombinations of old things (a new book is a recombination of pre-existing dictionary words), and even the most inventive creative work is still mostly older ideas, concepts, patterns borrowed from others. 

或这句话讲，如果 x 没有创作，Y 随后也会很快作出同样的创作。更多我们不知道的是，几乎所有的“新”事物都来自于多个老事物的组合（一个新书是字段的重新组合），更甚者，哪怕是极具创意的工作，也从其他人的工作中借鉴了来自过去的想法、观念、模式等。



Breakthrough ideas are usually made with the addition of one small idea to a mountain of other, older ideas. In that way ideas are really ecosystems. Ideas can not stand alone; they depend on other ideas for their force. Of course there can be a gem of a really original idea in a work but it is deeply entangled in a deep web of old patterns. 

突破性的想法往往也是站在巨人肩上的微小进步。在这种意义下，创意实际是一个整体性的生态，它没法单独存在，创意之前互相依赖。当然工作中也一定存在真正意义上的原创，但它必须深深的植根于深度的旧模式网络。



More importantly, we have a mistakenly romantic notion of how those crucial key ideas arrive. The popular notion is the hero creates the key idea with immense struggle alone, and if it were not for them, this greatness would otherwise never appear.

更重要的是，对于发明，我们有一种浪漫的错误。误以为广为人知的发明都是某个英雄在反复多次努力后，迸发了关键的创意。好像如果他们失败，这些伟大的创意就再也不会出现一样。



We tend to believe that Einstein’s, or Picasso’s, or Tolkien’s ideas or patterns would have only come to them, but that is incorrect. The evidence shows otherwise (read a good biography), which is why today every single creation (either artistic, technical, or scientific) that becomes super successful will be sued by others who claim to have invented, discovered, or created something similar at the same time or before. 

我们相信爱因斯坦，毕加索、托尔金的作品必须由他们创作，但这是错误的。证据表明，今天每一位超级成功的独立创作者（艺术、技术、科学）都会被他其他人起诉，他们声称自己同时或更早之前曾发明/发现，或者创作了相同的作品。



The more our modern world gets connected in real time, the more visible this multiple creation becomes. People have the same great idea at the same time. And increasingly more people are having the same idea at the same time. That is because the ideas arise from our common wealth.

当然文明世界越实时互联，也就会越来越多的出现多人同时创新。人们同时拥有相同的伟大想法，更多的人们同时拥有更多的想法，这是因为想法来自于我们共同的基础。



It is in the commons that ideas blossom.When scientific discoveries are shared, they can be accelerated. When the blueprints of inventions are shared (and not hidden) new inventions spring up faster. 

基于共识，创意才能百花齐放。当科学发现被分享时，他们会被加速。当发明的蓝图被分享时，新的发明会被大大加速。



Walt Disney made his fortune by reworking public domain fairy tales. Because the stories were already in the commons, he was able to re-interpret them into modern forms. As many others also did. In recent years, Disney has begun to create new fairy tales, but they are not shared in the commons. Even after the death of Disney, when he can no longer be incentivized, his stories are given a monopoly.

The maximum gain to society would come if those stories, too, were returned into the public domain commons. But ironically Disney has been the chief force in preventing copyrights in the US to return to the commons.

迪士尼创始人 Walt Disney 基于公版通话故事的再创作积累了自己的财富。因为这些故事已经是公共版权，他才能用现代方式进行重新创作，很多其他人也是这么做的。近年来迪士尼开始创作新的童话故事，但他们并未共享。即便是在 Walt 不再创作的死后，他创作的故事依然被赋予专有权。 这对于社会本应该也是更大的收回，如果迪士尼共享这些故事给公共领域。但讽刺的是，Disney 是阻止版权回归公域的最大反对力量。



Rather than concede there are multiple origins, our current system rewards the first person who claims to be the first. But the ownership we bestow on the first to claim originality it is rather arbitrary, although it does indeed spur more effort. A better way of accounting is to admit that all ideas and intellectual goodness is actually born from the commons and into the commons, from the pool of all that is known. 

即使基于多个来源的创作，当然的体系依然奖励最先宣称所有权的第一人。我们把所有权这样赋予第一个宣称的拥有人有些过于随意，即使这样确实刺激到了更多的努力创作。一个更好的办法是承认所有想法和创意来自于公共，并且回归公共。



That is, ideas arise from the commonwealth of all knowledge and current ideas. Without this commonwealth of knowledge, there would be no new ideas. However, if no one is rewarded for working on bringing new ideas to life, then far few would try. 

那是因为，创意来自于公共版权已有的所有知识，没有这些基础，就不会产生任何新想法。还有，如果为生活带入新想法得不到奖励，那么就很少会有人进行长做尝试了。



So even though the reward for originality is arbitrary, it is still useful. My proposal then is that we continue to award monopolies briefly on those who claim first rights (while acknowledging it is basically arbitrary). So for a brief period of time we remove this idea from the commons and bestow a monopoly upon it. 

The “owner” has exclusive rights for that monopoly period. But as soon as possible it is returned to the commons where great things can happen. A novel thing is born from the commons, and it is returned to the commons as soon as possible.

In the meantime to encourage future creation we give it a temporarily limited monopoly. In my model, the natural home of intangibles is in the commons, as a default.

所以，即便奖励原创的想法是随意的，但它依然是有用的。我的建议是，继续奖励第一个宣称拥有专属权的概念（同时要意识到这基本上是不严谨的）。然后在一段时间内，我们赋予所有权并给与保护。所有人在既定时间内拥有所有权，但所有权需要尽快回归那些会产生伟大想法的公共领域。一部小说产生于公共，同时也应该尽早的回归公共。同时我们用给与临时受限所有权鼓励未来的创作。在我的模式中，无形资产默认的自然归属就是公共领域。



For best results for society, this monopoly should be as minimal as possible in its duration and privileges. “Soon as possible” is the key phrase. No IP should last a century, no matter what. In our fast-moving world, 20 years of protection is more than enough for most ideas. Another step is to emphasize the rights of monopolies should have corresponding duties. 

为了社会利益最大化，专属权在时间和特权上都应该尽小范围。尽早是关键。不管什么样的 IP 都不应该持续一个世纪。在当下这个快速发展的世界里，20年的保护前已经足够长了。另一个好的方式是专属权需要承担相应的职责。



Those duties might include publication, dissemination, education, APIs, platform tools, or many other tools that would facilitate its use when it returns to the commons.

The books I have written are created from words invented by others, filled with ideas created by others. Even the few new ideas that are new depend on older ideas to work. 

What I had to say would probably be said by someone else not long after me. (More probably there have already been said by someone I was not aware of.) I may be the lucky person to claim those rare new ideas, but the worth of my art primarily resides in the great accumulation of the ideas and works of thousands of writers and thinkers before me — what I call the commons. 

My work was born in the commons, it gets its value by being deeply connected to the commons, and after my brief stewardship of those tiny new bits, it should return to the commons as fast as possible, in as many ways as possible.

这些职责可能包含公共出版，教育、接口、平台工具，或者其他公共领域的基础设施。

我写的书用的是别人创作的词汇，引用了其他人的很多想法，少部分的新想法也是基于更早的想法。我必须要说的、也许随后其他人也会说到（也许其他人已经说了只是我不知道），也许我只是那个能说出这些想法的幸运者，但必须说明，我的成就依赖于我之前成千上万的作家和思想者，就是我一直说的公共领域。

我的工作产生于公共，它基于公共汇聚到了自身的价值，所以在我短暂的拥有这些小点的版权后，它应该尽快回归公共，应该被更大化的利用。



That may strike others as romantic as the heroic stance. What happens in the details? We can imagine a very short half life of protection for ideas in patents and science, but it is harder to imagine for characters and stories in literature. They seem more like children than inventions. 

Would we want Harry Potter to be returned to the commons before JK Rowling died? Is that just cruel? So we already have a different time scale for copyrights vs patents (but of course I think the current Lifetime Plus scale for US copyright is ludicrous and bonkers). But if we were guided by this inverted perspective we would be doing as many things as possible to widen the common use, to make fair use the default stance, to assume that intangibles should start in the commonwealth and return to it as soon as possible. 

这也许会打击那些浪漫的英雄主义者。我们可以想象专利与科技的短暂保护期，但很难接受同样的逻辑应用于文学领域的故事和角色。他们就像是作者的孩子一样。

我们期望哈利波特在 JK Rowling 死前回归公共么？我们已经在专利和版权之间有了不同的保护期（当然，我认为当今美国超过一生的版权保护期是不合理的）。

如果我们被这种视角引导，我们也会做更多类似的事情来扩张公共应用，用默认规则推动合理应用，去假设无形资产应该从公共有用开始并尽快回归公共领域。



Use of snippets, copies in transit, sampling, remixing, gray areas, would all be seen as natural, and the default. Creators would borrow easily, make generously, and we would minimize the benefits of illusionary sole proprietorship.

This illusion, BTW, reigns not just in the arts, but throughout American culture, especially in the business world, where narrative of the lone American genius battling the entrenched biases of the establishment and breaking through with his personal heroic “aha” moment is the set storyline. 

引用片段、样章、混合使用、灰色地带都是自然的默认选项。创作者应该更容易的借用，更好的创作，我们应该最小化来自错误独有财产权的利益。这种幻想，不仅仅在艺术领域，更是充斥与整个美国文化，尤其是商业世界。最具代表的故事线就是独身的美国天才不断与固化偏见多次搏斗后，个人英雄般的在 “aha” 瞬间取得突破。



If you add a layer of politics, then the lone hero is battling the socialistic tendencies weighing down the masses with victimhood, and then we have the story of this decade. I am under no illusion myself that my communitarian perspective of ideas as being born from the commons, not from heroic individuals, and returning to the commons widely as fast as possible, will be adopted voluntarily. 

再从政治角度看，那么孤独的英雄正在与社会主义倾向作斗争，用受害者身份压倒群众，于是就有了最近这十年。我没有任何幻想，我对创意的表达角度是也是来自于公共领域，而不是来自我的个人英雄。我的创意也需要尽快的回归将被逐渐建立的更具意义的公共领域。



But like the initial resistance to accepting that copies want to flow freely (another communistic tendency), these resistances in the end are overwhelmed by the inherent biases in technology. See the music industry, which fought against streaming for decades before succumbing to the inevitable.

Ideas want to be shared. Sharing is baked into their nature. They don’t want to be owned, since ownership diminishes their usefulness. In the end, ideas will move in the direction of maximum sharing regardless of what the law says. And over time the law will codify what technology wants.

但就像最早反对接受副本应该自由流通（另外一种共产主义思想），这些反对最后被技术固有的偏见所淹没，比如音乐行业几十年前就开始对抗流媒体。

创意想要被分享，分享是本质。创意不想被独有，独占没用。最后，创意并不会按照法律规定变化，而是向更可能被分享的方向发展，假以时日，法律将会被技术的发展改写。
